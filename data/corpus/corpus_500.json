      "abstract": "We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the relationship between air pollutants and hospital admissions for respiratory and non-respiratory diseases in six metropolitan cities in South Korea. This study compared the associations between particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and hospital admission for respiratory and non-respiratory diseases before (2016-2019) and during (2020) the implementation of COVID-19 NPIs by using distributed lag non-linear models. In the Pre-COVID-19 period, the association between PM10 and admission risk for asthma and COPD showed an inverted U-shaped pattern. For PM2.5, S-shaped and inverted U-shaped changes were observed in asthma and COPD, respectively. Extremely high and low levels of PM10 and extremely low levels of PM2.5 significantly decreased the risk of admission for asthma and COPD. In the Post-COVID-19 outbreak period, the overall cumulative relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 and respiratory diseases and the effects of extreme levels of PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory diseases were completely changed. For non-respiratory diseases, PM10 and PM2.5 were statistically insignificant for admission risk during both periods. Our study may provide evidence that implementing NPIs and reducing PM10 and PM2.5 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to reducing hospital admissions for environment-based respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: As the results from epidemiological studies about the impact of outdoor air pollution on asthma in children are heterogeneous, our objective was to investigate the association between asthma exacerbation in children and exposure to air pollutants. METHODS: A database of 1 264 585 paediatric visits during the 2010-2015 period to the emergency rooms from 20 emergency departments (EDs) of 'Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP)', the largest hospital group in Europe, was used. A total of 47 107 visits were classified as asthma exacerbations. Concentration of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10  µm (PM10) and 2.5 µm (PM2.5)), as well as meteorological data, evolution of respiratory syncytial virus infection and pollen exposition, were collected on an hourly or daily basis for the same period using institutional databases. To assess the association between air pollution and asthma, mixed-effects quasi-Poisson regression modelling was performed. RESULTS: The only compound independently associated with ED visits for asthma was PM2.5 (P<10-4). The association between asthma exacerbation and PM2.5 was not linear, and a sigmoid function described the relationshipsatisfactorily. PM2.5 concentration, which gives half the maximum effect, was estimated at 13.5 µg/m3. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between daily asthma exacerbation in paediatric visits to the ED and fine particulate air pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Risk of asthma hospitalization and its disparities associated with air pollutant exposures are less clear within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, particularly at low degrees of exposure. Objectives: To assess effects of short-term exposures to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ⩽2.5 μm [PM2.5]), warm-season ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on risk of asthma hospitalization among national Medicaid beneficiaries, the most disadvantaged population in the United States, and to test whether any subpopulations were at higher risk. Methods: We constructed a time-stratified case-crossover dataset among 1,627,002 hospitalizations during 2000-2012 and estimated risk of asthma hospitalization associated with short-term PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposures. We then restricted the analysis to hospitalizations with degrees of exposure below increasingly stringent thresholds. Furthermore, we tested effect modifications by individual- and community-level characteristics. Measurements and Main Results: Each 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1-ppb increase in O3, and 1-ppb increase in NO2 was associated with 0.31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.37%), 0.10% (95% CI, 0.05 - 0.15%), and 0.28% (95% CI, 0.24 - 0.32%) increase in risk of asthma hospitalization, respectively. Low-level PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with higher risk. Furthermore, beneficiaries with only one asthma hospitalization during the study period or in communities with lower population density, higher average body mass index, longer distance to the nearest hospital, or greater neighborhood deprivation experienced higher risk. Conclusions: Short-term air pollutant exposures increased risk of asthma hospitalization among Medicaid beneficiaries, even at concentrations well below national standards. The subgroup differences suggested individual and contextual factors contributed to asthma disparities under effects of air pollutant exposures.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Outdoor air pollution causes emergency department visits and hospitalizations for childhood asthma. In the United States, the Air Quality Index (AQI) alerts the public to air quality and provides behavioral recommendations to reduce exposure and harm, yet little is known about the relationship between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations. Objectives: To test for association between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Methods: This was a retrospective time-stratified case-crossover study, conducted using medical records data from 2010 through 2018 for children aged 6-17 years with a primary diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency department visit or hospitalization for asthma) at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Daily AQI data was obtained for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from the Environmental Protection Agency. Conditional logistic regression was used for analyses of the AQI (as both a continuous and categorical variable) and asthma exacerbations. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore modification of the AQI effects on asthma exacerbations by race and other covariates. Results: There were 6,573 events. Particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) was the primary pollutant responsible for the AQI, followed by ozone (62% and 29% of days with events, respectively). The overall AQI was associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., as continuous, per 10-unit increase, Lag Day 2: odds ratio [OR], 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.025; Lag Day 3: OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001-1.023). By pollutant-specific AQI, the association was strongest for PM2.5. In stratified analyses, the AQI was associated with exacerbations in Black and younger children (6-11 yr) on Lag Day 4. Conclusions: The AQI is associated with asthma exacerbations among children in Allegheny County. This is driven primarily by PM2.5, with Black and younger children particularly affected. Healthcare providers should discuss the AQI in asthma management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is positively associated with acute cardiovascular and respiratory events. Understanding whether this association varies across specific cardiovascular and respiratory conditions has important biologic, clinical, and public health implications. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of hospitalizations from 2000 through 2014 among United States Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+. The outcomes were hospitalizations with any of 57 cardiovascular and 32 respiratory discharge diagnoses. We estimated associations with two-day moving average PM2.5 as a piecewise linear term with a knot at PM2.5 = 25 g/m3. We used Multi-Outcome Regression with Tree-structured Shrinkage (MOReTreeS) to identify de novo groups of related diseases such that PM2.5 associations are: (1) similar within outcome groups; but (2) different between outcome groups. We adjusted for temperature, humidity, and individual-level characteristics. We introduce an R package, moretrees. RESULTS: Our dataset included 16,007,293 cardiovascular and 8,690,837 respiratory hospitalizations. Of 57 cardiovascular diseases, 51 were grouped and positively associated with PM2.5. We observed a stronger positive association for heart failure, which formed a separate group. We observed negative associations for groups containing the outcomes other aneurysm and intracranial hemorrhage. Of 32 respiratory outcomes, 31 were grouped and were positively associated with PM2.5. Influenza formed a separate group with a negative association. CONCLUSIONS: We used a new statistical approach, MOReTreeS, to uncover variation in the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory causes controlling for patient characteristics, time trends, and environmental confounders.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of air pollutants on hospital admissions for respiratory disease (RD) by using distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) in Lanzhou during 2014-2019. In this study, the dataset of air pollutants, meteorological, and daily hospital admissions for RD in Lanzhou, from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2019, were collected from three national environmental monitoring stations, China meteorological data service center, and three large general hospitals, respectively. A time-series analysis with DLNM was used to estimate the associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions for RD including the stratified analysis of age, gender, and season. The key findings were expressed as the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for single-day and cumulative lag effects (0-7). A total of 90, 942 RD hospitalization cases were identified during the study period. The highest association (RR, 95% CI) of hospital admissions for RD and PM2.5 (1.030, 1.012-1.049), and PM10 (1.009, 1.001-1.015), and NO2 (1.047, 1.024-1.071) were observed at lag 07 for an increase of 10 μg/m3 in the concentrations, and CO at lag07 (1.140, 1.052-1.236) for an increase of 1 mg/m3 in the concentration. We observed that the RR estimates for gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO and NO2) were larger than those of particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10). The harmful effects of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO were greater in male, people aged 0-14 group and in the cold season. However, no significant association was observed for SO2, O38h, and total hospital admissions for RD. Therefore, some effective intervention strategies should be taken to strengthen the treatment of the ambient air pollutants, especially gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO and NO2), thereby, reducing the burden of respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of several respiratory diseases in children, especially respiratory tract infections. The present study aims to evaluate the association between pediatric emergency department (PED) presentations for bronchiolitis and air pollution. PED presentations due to bronchiolitis in children aged less than 1 year were retrospectively collected from 2007 to 2018 in Padova, Italy, together with daily environmental data. A conditional logistic regression based on a time-stratified case-crossover design was performed to evaluate the association between PED presentations and exposure to NO2 , PM2.5, and PM10. Models were adjusted for temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and public holidays. Delayed effects in time were evaluated using distributed lag non-linear models. Odds ratio for lagged exposure from 0 to 14 days were obtained. Overall, 2251 children presented to the PED for bronchiolitis. Infants' exposure to higher concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in the 5 days before the presentation to the PED increased the risk of accessing the PED by more than 10%, whereas high concentrations of NO2 between 2 and 12 days before the PED presentation were associated with an increased risk of up to 30%. The association between pollutants and infants who required hospitalization was even greater. A cumulative effect of NO2 among the 2 weeks preceding the presentation was also observed. In summary, PM and NO2 concentrations are associated with PED presentations and hospitalizations for bronchiolitis. Exposure of infants to air pollution could damage the respiratory tract mucosa, facilitating viral infections and exacerbating symptoms.",

We surveyed the relationship between AURI hospitalizations and air pollutant concentrations in children aged 0-14 years from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019 in Lanzhou City. METHODS: We collected both data on air pollutant concentrations and children's AURI hospitalizations during the study period. Distributional lagged nonlinear models were adopted to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants on children's AURI hospitalizations. We also performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15,881 children were hospitalized for AURI during the study period. The results showed that for each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 , SO2 , and NO2 concentrations at lag0-6, the relative risk (RR) values for children hospitalized for AURI were RR = 1.0247 (95% CI: 1.0092,1.0405), RR = 1.0928 (95% CI: 1.0562, 1.1308), and RR = 1.0715 (95% CI: 1.0495, 1.0940), respectively. PM10 was significantly associated with AURI hospitalization in children only at lag0, RR = 1.0028 (95% CI: 1.0000, 1.0056).

      "abstract": "Some chemotherapies that treat childhood cancers have pulmonary-toxic properties that increase risk for adverse respiratory-health outcomes. PM2.5 causes similar outcomes but its effect among pulmonary compromised cancer survivors is unknown. This case-crossover study identified the PM2.5-associated odds for primary-respiratory hospitalizations and emergency department visits among childhood cancer survivors in Utah. We compared risk among chemotherapy-treated survivors to a cancer-free sample. We calculated 3-day-average PM2.5 by ZIP code and county for event and control days. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios. Models were stratified by cause of admission (infection, respiratory disease, asthma), previous chemotherapy, National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), and other variables. Results are presented per 10 µg/m³ of PM2.5. 90% of events occurred at 3-day PM2.5 averages <35.4 µg/m³, the NAAQS 24-h standard. For survivors, PM2.5 was associated with respiratory hospitalizations (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.13⁻3.00) and hospitalizations from respiratory infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.06⁻4.14). Among chemotherapy-treated survivors, the PM2.5-associated odds of respiratory hospitalization (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.14⁻3.61) were significantly higher than the cancer-free sample (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.57⁻1.25). This is the first study to report significant associations between PM2.5 and respiratory healthcare encounters in childhood cancer survivors. Chemotherapy-treated survivors displayed the highest odds of hospitalization due to PM2.5 exposure and their risk is significantly higher than a cancer-free sample.",

      "abstract": "RATIONAL: Several studies have found higher risks for childhood respiratory illness, associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM) less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) and PM2.5 and gaseous pollution. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the association between air pollution and hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis, an obstructive pulmonary disorder, commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus infant infection. METHODS: Data were obtained from a local tertiary medical center providing services for a population of 700,000 comprising two ethnic groups: predominantly urban Jews and rural Bedouin Arabs. The latter group includes 30% residing in unrecognized villages in a temporary dwelling. We included all infants (0-2 yr) hospitalized with bronchiolitis between 2003 and 2013. Daily PM estimates were obtained from a satellite-based model incorporating daily remote sensing data and assigned to the family residence locality. Other air pollutants and meteorological parameters were obtained from a local monitoring site. We used case-crossover models with adjustment for temperature. RESULTS: We identified 4,069 bronchiolitis hospitalizations (3,889 children), with 55.3% being Bedouin Arabs, of whom 16.8% resided in temporary dwellings. An increase in interquartile range of average weekly air pollutants was associated with an increased odds of bronchiolitis (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]): PM10 (1.06 [1.02-1.09]), PM2.5 (1.04 [1.02-1.06]) and nitrogen dioxide (1.36 [1.12-1.65]). Higher effect-estimates for PM were observed among Bedouin Arabs residing in temporary dwellings (1.14 [1.01-1.30] and 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) compared with Jewish individuals (1.05 [0.99-1.11] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]) and other Bedouin Arabs (1.05 [1.01-1.10] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]), and among males (1.11 [1.06-1.16] and 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) compared with females (0.99 [0.94-1.05] and 1.01 [0.97-1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: High PM levels were positively associated with bronchiolitis. The stronger associations among Bedouin Arabs may be related to higher pollution infiltration and exposure in residents of temporary dwellings.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Outdoor particulate and gaseous air pollutants impair respiratory health in children, and these associations may be influenced by particle composition. Objectives: To examine whether associations between short-term variations in fine particulate air pollution, oxidant gases, and respiratory hospitalizations in children are modified by particle constituents (metals and sulfur) or oxidative potential. Methods: We conducted a case-crossover study of 10,500 children (0-17 years of age) across Canada. Daily fine particle mass concentrations and oxidant gases (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) were collected from ground monitors. Monthly estimates of fine particle constituents (metals and sulfur) and oxidative potential were also measured. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between air pollutants and respiratory hospitalizations, above and below median values for particle constituents and oxidative potential. Measurements and Main Results: Lag-1 fine particulate matter mass concentrations were not associated with respiratory hospitalizations (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 μg/m3 increase in fine particulate matter: 1.004 [0.955-1.056]) in analyses ignoring particle constituents and oxidative potential. However, when models were examined above or below median metals, sulfur, and oxidative potential, positive associations were observed above the median. For example, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 μg/m3 increase in fine particulate matter were 1.084 (1.007-1.167) when copper was above the median and 0.970 (0.929-1.014) when copper was below the median. Similar trends were observed for oxidant gases. Conclusions: Stronger associations were observed between outdoor fine particles, oxidant gases, and respiratory hospitalizations in children when metals, sulfur, and particle oxidative potential were elevated.",

OBJECTIVE: To identify a possible association between exposure to air pollutants and hospitalizations due to SARS-Cov-2. DESIGN AND SETTING: Ecological time-series study carried out in Taubaté, Tremembé, and Pindamonhangaba in 2020 and 2021. METHODS: Study with Sars-Cov-2 hospitalizations with information on hospitalization date, sex and age of the subjects, duration of hospitalization, type of discharge, and costs of these hospitalizations. Statistical analysis was performed through a negative binomial regression, with data on pollutant concentrations, temperature, air relative humidity, and hospitalization date. Coefficients obtained by the analysis were transformed into relative risk for hospitalization, which estimated hospitalizations excess according to an increase in pollutant concentrations. RESULTS: There were 1,300 hospitalizations and 368 deaths, with a predominance of men (61.7%). These data represent an incidence rate of 250.4 per 100,000 inhabitants and 28.4% hospital lethality. Significant exposure (P value < 0.05) occurred seven days before hospital admission (lag 7) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (relative risk, RR = 1.0124) and two days before hospital admission for PM2.5 (RR = 1.0216). A 10 μg/m3 in NO2 concentration would decrease by 320 hospitalizations and » US $ 240,000 in costs; a 5 μg/m3 in PM2.5 concentration would decrease by 278 hospitalizations and » US $ 190,000 in costs. CONCLUSION: An association between exposure to air pollutants and hospital admission due to Sars-Cov-2 was observed with excess hospitalization and costs for the Brazilian public health system.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of short-term ambient air pollution exposure and asthma morbidity in the United States have been limited to a small number of cities and/or pollutants and with limited consideration of effects across ages. OBJECTIVES: To estimate acute age group-specific effects of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM), major PM components, and gaseous pollutants on emergency department (ED) visits for asthma during 2005-2014 across the United States. METHODS: We acquired ED visit and air quality data in regions surrounding 53 speciation sites in 10 states. We used quasi-Poisson log-linear time-series models with unconstrained distributed exposure lags to estimate site-specific acute effects of air pollution on asthma ED visits overall and by age group (1-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ y), controlling for meteorology, time trends, and influenza activity. We then used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate pooled associations from site-specific associations. RESULTS: Our analysis included 3.19 million asthma ED visits. We observed positive associations for multiday cumulative exposure to all air pollutants examined [e.g., 8-d exposure to PM2.5: rate ratio of 1.016 with 95% credible interval (CI) of (1.008, 1.025) per 6.3-μg/m3 increase, PM10-2.5: 1.014 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.020) per 9.6-μg/m3 increase, organic carbon: 1.016 (95% CI: 1.009, 1.024) per 2.8-μg/m3 increase, and ozone: 1.008 (95% CI: 0.995, 1.022) per 0.02-ppm increase]. PM2.5 and ozone showed stronger effects at shorter lags, whereas associations of traffic-related pollutants (e.g., elemental carbon and oxides of nitrogen) were generally stronger at longer lags. Most pollutants had more pronounced effects on children (<18 y old) than adults; PM2.5 had strong effects on both children and the elderly (>64 y old); and ozone had stronger effects on adults than children. CONCLUSIONS: We reported positive associations between short-term air pollution exposure and increased rates of asthma ED visits. We found that air pollution exposure posed a higher risk for children and older populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11661.",

      "title": "Effect of ambient PM",
      "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important component of natural and human-generated air pollution and a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Short-term effects of PM2.5 exposure on respiratory illness have been described but most evidence arises from high pollution settings. We used case-crossover methods to estimate effects of outdoor PM2.5 levels on emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a range of acute respiratory illnesses and age groups in Melbourne, Australia from 2014-2019, with and without adjustment for other pollutants and weather conditions, using daily and one-week averaged lags. We estimated incidence rate ratios for a 10 μg/m3 increase in 7-day average ambient PM2.5 of 1.043 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.089) on ED presentation and 1.013 (95% CI: 0.971-1.056) on hospital admissions for acute respiratory illnesses for patients of any age. We observed distinct temporal patterns in daily lag effect by disease. The largest effects on acute lower respiratory tract infection and asthma were observed in children. Ambient PM2.5 levels rarely exceeded standards in place at the time. Although uncertainty around most point estimates was relatively wide, these findings are most compatible with adverse health effects of ambient PM2.5 at levels below currently established Australian national standards.Implications: Understanding the health impacts of air pollution is important for setting air quality targets, as well as for informing robust health system planning. Adverse effects of exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter on human respiratory health have been consistently described. However, most studies have been done in higher-pollution settings. Further, many studies have assessed health effects in broad categories such as all-cause respiratory mortality or hospitalization, and thus lack the granularity to inform detailed health service planning. Our study aimed to estimate effects of outdoor fine particulate matter on emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a range of acute respiratory illnesses and age groups in Melbourne, Australia, a city with relatively good air quality by international comparison. Our study estimated consistent effects on both ED presentations and hospital admissions compatible with distinct patterns of adverse health effects at levels at or below established Australian national (and many international) standards. These results will help to inform both air quality policy and public health policy in similar settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The influences of air pollution exposure and temperature on respiratory diseases have become major global health concerns. This study investigated the relationship between ambient air pollutant concentrations and temperature in cold industrial cities that have the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases. METHODS: A time-series study was conducted in Changchun, China, from 2015 to 2019 to analyse the number of daily admissions for respiratory diseases, air pollutant concentrations, and meteorological factors. Time-series decomposition was applied to analyse the trend and characteristics of the number of admissions. Generalized additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models were constructed to explore the effects of air pollutant concentrations and temperature on the number of admissions. RESULTS: The number of daily admissions showed an increasing trend, and the seasonal fluctuation was obvious, with more daily admissions in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. There were positive and gradually decreasing lag effects of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and CO concentrations on the number of admissions, whereas O3 showed a J-shaped trend. The results showed that within the 7-day lag period, 0.5°C was the temperature associated with the lowest relative risk of admission due to respiratory disease, and extremely low and high temperatures (<-18°C, >27°C, respectively) increased the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases by 8.3% and 12.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From 2015 to 2019, respiratory diseases in Changchun showed an increasing trend with obvious seasonality. The increased concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5, O3 and PM10 lead to an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases, with a significant lag effect. Both extreme heat and cold could lead to increases in the risk of admission due to respiratory disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prior studies have reported the effects of particulate matter (PM) on respiratory disease (RD) hospitalizations, but few have quantified PM-related economic loss in the central region of China. This investigation aimed to assess the impacts of PM pollution on the risk burden and economic loss of patients admitted with RD. METHODS: Daily cases of RD admitted to the hospital from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 were collected from two class-A tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Time series analysis incorporated with a generalized additive model (GAM) was adopted to assess the impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and inhalable particulate matter (PM10) exposures on patients hospitalized with RD. Stratified analyses were performed to investigate underlying effect modification of RD risk by sex, age, and season. The cost of illness (COI) approach was applied to evaluate the related economic losses caused by PM. RESULTS: A total of 51,676 inpatients with a primary diagnosis of RD were included for the analysis. PM2.5 and PM10 exposures were associated with increased risks of hospitalizations for RD. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that men and children in the 0-14 years age group were more vulnerable to PM, and the adverse effects were promoted by low temperature in the cold season. A 152.4 million China Yuan (CNY) economic loss could be avoided if concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 declined to 10 and 20 μg/m3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were positively associated with RD hospitalization. Men and children were more vulnerable to PM. Effective air pollution control measures can reduce hospitalizations significantly and save economic loss substantially.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfire activity in the United States has increased substantially in recent decades. Smoke fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), a primary wildfire emission, can remain in the air for months after a wildfire begins, yet large-scale evidence of its health effects remains limited. METHODS: We obtained hospitalization records for the residents of 15 states between 2006 and 2016 from the State Inpatient Databases. We used existing daily smoke PM 2.5 estimations at 10-km 2 grid cells across the contiguous United States and aggregated them to ZIP codes to match the spatial resolution of hospitalization records. We extended the traditional case-crossover design, a self-controlled design originally developed for studying acute effects, to examine associations between 3-month average exposure to smoke PM 2.5 and hospitalization risks for a comprehensive range of cardiovascular (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases) and respiratory diseases (acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other respiratory diseases). RESULTS: We found that 3-month exposure to smoke PM 2.5 was associated or marginally associated with increased hospitalization risks for most cardiorespiratory diseases. Hypertension showed the greatest susceptibility, with the highest hospitalization risk associated with 0.1 µg/m 3 increase in 3-month smoke PM 2.5 exposure (relative risk: 1.0051; 95% confidence interval = 1.0035, 1.0067). Results for single-month lagged exposures suggested that estimated effects persisted up to 3 months after exposure. Subgroup analyses estimated larger effects in neighborhoods with higher deprivation level or more vegetation, as well as among ever-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided unique insights into medium-term cardiorespiratory effects of smoke PM 2.5 , which can persist for months, even after a wildfire has ended.",

Data on hospital visits due to URTI from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2012 were obtained from the Beijing Medical Claim Data for Employees, a health insurance database. Daily PM2.5 concentration was acquired from the embassy of the United States of America (US) located in Beijing. A generalized additive Poisson model was used to analyze the effect of PM2.5 on hospital visits for URTI. We found that a 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with 0.84% (95% CI, 0.05⁻1.64%) increase in hospital admissions for URTI at lag 0⁻3 days, but there were no significant associations with emergency room or outpatient visits. Compared to females, males were more likely to be hospitalized for URTI when the PM2.5 level increased, but other findings did not differ by age group or gender. The study suggests that short-term variations in PM2.5 concentrations have small but detectable impacts on hospital utilization due to URTI in adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution poses a major risk for the development and aggravation of respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that even in low-level air pollution environments there is a risk for an increase in adverse respiratory symptoms. We examined whether variations in daily air pollution levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or particulate matter in Berlin, Germany were associated with hospital admissions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patients in a time series analysis. METHODS: We calculated single and multi-pollutant models, investigated possible lags in effect, and analysed the influence of meteorological variables on the results. Data from January 2005 through December 2015 were used to quantify the concentration-response. RESULTS: The risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised on the same day of NO2 exposure was 1.101 per 10 µg/m3 NO2 increase (95% CI: 1.013 to 1.195), for COPD patients 1.123 (95% CI: 1.081 to 1.168). Neither the exposure to ozone (95% CI: 0.904 to 1.020), PM10 (95% CI: 0.990 to 1.127), nor PM2.5 (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.148) was associated with an increased risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised. Risk ratios for the hospital admission of COPD patients were also not increased due to ozone (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.033), PM10 (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.032), or PM2.5 (95% CI: 0.966 to 1.019) exposure. The presented risk ratios and confidence intervals relate to the day of exposure. We found no increased hospitalisation risks with a delayed occurrence on subsequent days. CONCLUSIONS: A quantifiable, statistically significant increase in risk for asthma and COPD exacerbations owing to NO2 exposure at levels well below European regulatory limit values was observed.",

      "title": "Wildfire Smoke Exposure and Cause-Specific Hospitalization in Older Adults.",
      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The escalating intensity of wildfires in the western US is increasing exposure to smoke pollution. Previous studies of wildfire smoke and health have primarily focused on mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular events, with limited research on broader health impacts or on the shape of concentration-response curves. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between exposure to smoke-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cause-specific hospitalizations among older adults in the western US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare inpatient claims data from 2006 to 2016 linked with machine learning-derived smoke-specific PM2.5 to assess associations between smoke PM2.5 and hospitalization rates. Participants included Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older who lived in a western US state (ie, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, or Wyoming). Analyses were conducted from October 2023 to February 2025. EXPOSURES: Daily county-level smoke-specific PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from machine learning models trained on monitor and satellite data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily county-level rates of unscheduled hospitalization for each of 13 broad cause categories. To characterize the association between each cause of hospitalization and smoke PM2.5, distributed lag models were fitted with hospitalization rates modeled as a function of same-day smoke PM2.5 exposure and exposures on each day of the preceding week, using splines on exposure to allow for nonlinearity. RESULTS: The study included 10 369 361 individuals (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.9] years; 4 862 826 male [46.9%]; 5 506 535 female [53.1%]; 373 252 Black [3.6%]; 420 577 Hispanic [4.1%]; and 8 365 607 White [80.7%]), 57 million person-months of follow-up, and 4.7 million unscheduled hospitalizations. Smoke PM2.5 concentration-response curves for respiratory hospitalizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations were flat at lower concentrations but showed increasing trends at concentrations above 25 μg/m3. On average, daily hospitalizations (per 100 000) increased by 2.40 (95% CI, 0.17 to 4.63) for respiratory concerns when increasing same-day and preceding week smoke PM2.5 concentrations from 0 to 40 μg/m3; hospitalizations for cardiovascular concerns increased by 2.61 (95% CI, -0.09 to 5.30), a difference that was not statistically significant. No associations were observed for other causes of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, exposure to high levels of smoke pollution was associated with an increase in hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. These findings underscore the need for interventions to mitigate the health impacts of wildfire smoke exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfire smoke is known to exacerbate respiratory conditions; however, evidence for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events has been inconsistent, despite biological plausibility. METHODS AND RESULTS: A population-based epidemiologic analysis was conducted for daily cardiovascular and cerebrovascular emergency department (ED) visits and wildfire smoke exposure in 2015 among adults in 8 California air basins. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used for zip code-level counts of ED visits, adjusting for heat index, day of week, seasonality, and population. Satellite-imaged smoke plumes were classified as light, medium, or dense based on model-estimated concentrations of fine particulate matter. Relative risk was determined for smoky days for lag days 0 to 4. Rates of ED visits by age- and sex-stratified groups were also examined. Rates of all-cause cardiovascular ED visits were elevated across all lags, with the greatest increase on dense smoke days and among those aged ≥65 years at lag 0 (relative risk 1.15, 95% confidence interval [1.09, 1.22]). All-cause cerebrovascular visits were associated with smoke, especially among those 65 years and older, (1.22 [1.00, 1.49], dense smoke, lag 1). Respiratory conditions were also increased, as anticipated (1.18 [1.08, 1.28], adults >65 years, dense smoke, lag 1). No association was found for the control condition, acute appendicitis. Elevated risks for individual diagnoses included myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, dysrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of an extensive wildfire season found smoke exposure to be associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ED visits for all adults, particularly for those over aged 65 years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several studies suggest that air pollution, particularly PM2.5, increases morbidity and mortality, Emergency Department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations for acute respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, no prior study in Southeastern Asia (SEA) has examined the effects of air pollutants on ED visits and health outcomes. This study focused on the association of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of PM2.5 and other pollutants' effects on ED visits, hospitalization, and unexpected deaths due to acute respiratory disease, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute heart failure (AHF), and stroke. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study with daily data from ED visits between 2018 and 2019 at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand. The AQI of air pollution data was collected from outdoor air quality from the Smoke Haze Integrated Research Unit and the Air Quality Index Visual Map. A distributed lag, non-linear and quasi-Poisson models were used to explore the relationship between air quality parameters and ED visits for each disease. RESULTS: 3,540 ED visits were recorded during the study period. The mean daily AQI of PM2.5 was 89.0 ± 40.2. We observed associations between AQI of PM2.5 and the ED visits due to ACS on the following day (RR = 1.023, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002-1.044) and two days after exposure (RR = 1.026, 95% CI: 1.005-1.047). Also, subgroup analysis revealed the association between AQI of PM2.5 and the ED visits due to pneumonia on the current day (RR = 1.071, 95% CI: 1.025-1.118) and on the following day after exposure (RR = 1.024, 95% CI: 1.003-1.046). AQI of PM2.5 associated with increased mortality resulted from ACS on lag day 3 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.73). The AQI of PM10 is also associated with increased ED visits due to COPD/asthma and increased hospitalization in AHF. In addition, the AQI of O3 and AQI of NO2 is associated with increased ICU admissions and mortality in AHF. CONCLUSION: Short-term PM2.5 exposure escalates ED visits for ACS and pneumonia. PM10's AQI associates with COPD/asthma ED visits and AHF hospitalizations. AQI of O3 and NO2's link to increased ICU admissions and AHF mortality. Urgent action against air pollution is vital to safeguard public health.",

      "abstract": "Studies about the pneumonia morbidity effects of various air pollution exposure are still limited in China. We aimed to explore the short-term effect of air pollutants exposure on pneumonia admission and identify the vulnerable groups in Qingdao, China. From January 2015 to October 2017, a prospective cohort involving 433,032 participants across 3 counties in Qingdao were enrolled in the study. Distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the associations between air pollutants and pneumonia hospitalizations. There were 636 cases of pneumonia, with an annual incidence density of 54.33 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 50.11, 58.56). A 10 μg/m3 increment of sulfur dioxide (SO2) distributed at a 4-week lag in Qingdao was associated with increased pneumonia hospitalizations, with a risk ratio of 2.10 (95% CI: 1.06, 4.13). Subgroup analyses indicate that PM ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter and SO2 showed stronger effects on pneumonia in females than males, whereas people in urban regions were more vulnerable to nitrogen dioxide and ozone (O3) than the others. We also observed distinct acute effects and harvesting effects of SO2 and O3 on pneumonia in urban areas. Strategies should be taken to further reduce levels of ambient PM2.5, SO2, and O3.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have reported associations of short-term exposure to different sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased mortality or hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. Few studies, however, have focused on the short-term effects of source-specific PM2.5 on emergency room visits (ERVs) of respiratory diseases. Source apportionment for PM2.5 was performed with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and generalized additive model was applied to estimate associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease ERVs. The association of PM2.5 and total respiratory ERVs was found on lag4 (RR = 1.011, 95%CI: 1.002, 1.020) per interquartile range (76 μg/m3) increase. We found PM2.5 to be significantly associated with asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ERVs, with the strongest effects on lag5 (RR = 1.072, 95%CI: 1.024, 1.119), lag4 (RR = 1.104, 95%CI: 1.032, 1.176) and lag3 (RR = 1.091, 95%CI: 1.047, 1.135), respectively. The estimated effects of PM2.5 changed little after adjusting for different air pollutants. Six primary PM2.5 sources were identified using PMF analysis, including dust/soil (6.7%), industry emission (4.5%), secondary aerosols (30.3%), metal processing (3.2%), coal combustion (37.5%) and traffic-related source (17.8%). Some of the sources were identified to have effects on ERVs of total respiratory diseases (dust/soil, secondary aerosols, metal processing, coal combustion and traffic-related source), bronchitis ERVs (dust/soil) and COPD ERVs (traffic-related source, industry emission and secondary aerosols). Different sources of PM2.5 contribute to increased risk of respiratory ERVs to different extents, which may provide potential implications for the decision making of air quality related policies, rational emission control and public health welfare.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution poses a threat to children's respiratory health. This study aims to quantify the association between short-term air pollution exposure and respiratory hospital admissions among children in Hanoi, Vietnam, and estimate the population-attributable burden using local data. A case-crossover analysis was conducted based on the individual records where each case is their own control. The health data was obtained from 13 hospitals in Hanoi and air pollution data was collected from four monitoring stations from 2007 to 2019. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate Percentage Change (PC) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in odd of hospital admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in daily average particulate matter (e.g. PM1, PM2.5, PM10), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), 8-h maximum Ozone and per 1000 μg/m3 increase in daily mean of Carbon Monoxide (CO). We also calculated the number and fraction of admissions attributed to air pollution in Hanoi by using the coefficient at lag 0. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the concentration of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, SO2, NO2, O3 8-h maximum and 1000 μg/m3 increase in CO concentration was associated with 0.6%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 0.8%, 1.6%, 0.3%, and 1.7% increase in odd of admission for all respiratory diseases among children under 16 years at lag 0-2. All PM metrics and NO2 are associated with childhood admission for pneumonia and bronchitis. Admissions due to asthma and upper respiratory diseases are related to increments in NO2 and CO. For attributable cases, PM2.5 concentrations in Hanoi exceeding the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines accounted for 1619 respiratory hospital admissions in Hanoi children in 2019. Our findings show that air pollution has a detrimental impact on the respiratory health of Hanoi children and there will be important health benefits from improved air quality management planning to reduce air pollution in Vietnam.",

Our research aimed to explore whether there is a correlation and to estimate how the association was distributed across various lags in Jinan, China.The relationships between ambient air pollutant concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and monthly hospitalizations for RA-ILD were studied by employing a general linear model with a Poisson distribution. This time-series study was performed from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2019.In the 5-year study, there were 221 hospitalizations for RA-ILD in Jinan city. The levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were significantly related to the number of admissions for RA-ILD. PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 showed the most significant effect on the month (lag 0), and NO2 was most related to RA-ILD at a lag of two months (lag 2). The monthly admissions of RA-ILD increased by 0.875% (95% CI: 0.375-1.377%), 0.548% (95% CI: 0.148-0.949%), 1.968% (95% CI: 0.869-3.080%), and 1.534% (95% CI: 0.305-2.778%) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2, respectively.This study might add more detailed evidence that higher levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increase the risk of hospitalizations for RA-ILD. Further study of the role of air pollution in the pathogenesis of RA-ILD is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Associations between pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and ambient concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) have been reported in previous studies, although few were performed in nonmetropolitan areas. OBJECTIVE: We estimated associations between daily PM2.5 concentrations, using a two-stage model that included land use parameters and satellite aerosol optical depth measurements at 1-km resolution, and ED visits for six pediatric conditions in the U.S. state of Georgia by urbanicity classification. METHODS: We obtained pediatric ED visits geocoded to residential ZIP codes for visits with nonmissing PM2.5 estimates and admission dates during 1 January 2002-30 June 2010 for 2- to 18-year-olds for asthma or wheeze (n = 189,816), and for 0- to 18-year-olds for bronchitis (n = 76,243), chronic sinusitis (n = 15,745), otitis media (n = 237,833), pneumonia (n = 52,946), and upper respiratory infections (n = 414,556). Daily ZIP code-level estimates of 24-hr average PM2.5 were calculated by averaging concentrations within ZIP code boundaries. We used time-stratified case-crossover models stratified on ZIP code, year, and month to estimate odds ratios (ORs) between ED visits and same-day and previous-day PM2.5 concentrations at the ZIP code level, and we investigated effect modification by county-level urbanicity. RESULTS: A 10-μg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5 concentrations was associated with ED visits for asthma or wheeze (OR = 1.013; 95% CI: 1.003, 1.023) and upper respiratory infections (OR = 1.015; 95% CI: 1.008, 1.022); associations with previous-day PM2.5 concentrations were lower. Differences in the association estimates across levels of urbanicity were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED visits for asthma or wheeze and for upper respiratory infections were associated with PM2.5 concentrations in Georgia.

      "abstract": "Prior studies reported excess rates (ERs) of cardiorespiratory events associated with short-term increases in PM2.5 concentrations, despite implementation of pollution-control policies. In 2017, Federal Tier 3 light-duty vehicle regulations began, and to-date there have been no assessments of population health effects of the policy. Using the NYS Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database, we obtained hospitalizations and ED visits with a principal diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for residents living within 15 miles of six urban PM2.5 monitoring sites in NYS (2014-2019). We used a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression (adjusting for ambient temperature, relative humidity, and weekday) to estimate associations between PM2.5, POC (primary organic carbon), SOC (secondary organic carbon), and rates of respiratory disease hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits from 2014 to 2019. We evaluated demographic disparities in these relative rates and compared changes in ERs before (2014-2016) and after Tier 3 implementation (2017-2019). Each interquartile range increase in PM2.5 was associated with increased ERs of asthma or COPD hospitalizations and ED visits in the previous 7 days (ERs ranged from 1.1%-3.1%). Interquartile range increases in POC were associated with increased rates of asthma ED visits (lag days 0-6: ER = 2.1%, 95% CI = 0.7%, 3.6%). Unexpectedly, the ERs of asthma admission and ED visits associated with PM2.5, POC, and SOC were higher during 2017-2019 (after Tier 3) than 2014-2016 (before Tier-3). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease analyses showed similar patterns. Excess Rates were higher in children (<18 years; asthma) and seniors (≥65 years; COPD), and Black, Hispanic, and NYC residents. In summary, unanticipated increases in asthma and COPD ERs after Tier-3 implementation were observed, and demographic disparities in asthma/COPD and PM2.5, POC, and SOC associations were also observed. Future work should confirm findings and investigate triggering of respiratory events by source-specific PM.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Abundant evidence has shown that an increase in the concentration of fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) leads to a simultaneous increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases. Xigu District is the main industrial district of Lanzhou, located in Lanzhou City in northwest China and central Gansu Province. Because of limited research and data in the region, the impact of PM2.5 on human health has not been systematically recognized. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 pollution and upper respiratory tract infections in urban industrial areas of Lanzhou City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on outpatient visits, air pollutants, and meteorological indices were collected in the Xigu District of Lanzhou City from 1 January 2013 - 31 December 2019. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate the association between PM2.5 and outpatient visits for upper respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: The results show that PM2.5 had the greatest impact on outpatient visits for upper respiratory tract infections on 7 cumulative lag days. At cumulative lag days 1, 3, and 5, the effects gradually increased. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of PM2.5 on visits for upper respiratory tract infections was significantly influenced by gender. Men were more susceptible to PM2.5 pollution. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in atmospheric PM2.5 concentration was associated with an increase in visits for upper respiratory tract infections with the lag effect. The obtained results can provide a reference for the development of prevention strategies to protect the population from the adverse effects of PM2.5 pollution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent increases in wildfire frequency and severity necessitate better understanding of health effects of wildfire smoke to protect affected populations. OBJECTIVES: We examined relationships between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and morbidity during wildfires in California, and whether those relationships differed during the fire compared to a similar non-fire period. METHODS: For nine San Francisco Bay Area counties, daily county-level diagnosis-specific counts of emergency department visits (EDVs) and hospitalizations were linked with county-level estimates of daily mean PM2.5 during the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and similar October days in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Associations were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The median difference between county PM2.5 during the fire versus the non-fire period was 23.4 μg/m3, with days exceeding 80 μg/m3 in some counties. Over the entire study period, PM2.5 was most consistently linked to EDVs for respiratory disease (RREDV(lag0) per 23.4 μg/m3 increase: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.30), asthma, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD; RREDV(lag0): 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.27), and acute myocardial infarction (RREDV(lag0): 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.25). Increases in acute upper respiratory infections and decreases in mental/behavioral EDVs were observed but were sensitive to model specification, specifically the inclusion of time-related covariates. Comparing fire and non-fire period EDV associations, we observed indications that PM2.5 during the fire was more strongly associated with asthma (RRlag0: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.55) compared to non-fire period PM2.5 (RRlag0: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.08), and the opposite observed for dysrhythmia, with the asthma difference being particularly robust to model choice. For hospitalizations, the most robust PM2.5 relationships were positive associations with respiratory, CLRD, and diabetes, and inverse associations with pneumonia. Respiratory and CLRD effect estimates were generally similar or smaller than for EDVs. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated short-term PM2.5 levels from wildfire smoke appears to impact respiratory and other health domains.",

We categorized the daily mean temperature and air pollutant variables based on the exposure-response curve of the Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model. Poisson regression model was used for interaction and stratification analysis. The Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between daily mean temperature (Tmean) and air pollutants including NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 were - 0.428 (95% CI - 0.637, - 0.218), -- 0.227 (95% CI - 0.293, - 0.161), and - 0.119 (95% CI - 0.159, - 0.079). Further stratification analysis showed the relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of high NO2 (> 33 μg/m3) at low Tmean (≤ 28 °C) was 1.119 (95% CI 1.096, 1.142). Low temperatures with high PM10 in men and high PM2.5 in women were associated with a higher risk of AECOPD hospitalization. The results indicate a higher risk of hospitalization for AECOPD when there is with high concentrations of air pollution at low temperatures.",

      "abstract": "Dust is a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in arid regions; therefore, concentrations of this pollutant in countries such as Kuwait exceed air quality standards. There is limited understanding on the impact and burden of high PM2.5 concentrations on morbidity in these countries. In this study, we explore the association of PM2.5 and the risk of respiratory hospital admissions in Kuwait. A time-series regression model was used to investigate daily variations in respiratory admissions and PM2.5 concentrations from 2010 to 2018. Due to the lack of historical air quality sampling in Kuwait, we used estimated daily PM2.5 levels from a hybrid PM2.5 prediction model. Individual and cumulative lag effects of PM2.5 over a 5-day period were estimated using distributed lag linear models. Associations were stratified by sex, age, and nationality. There were 218,749 total respiratory admissions in Kuwait during the study period. Results indicate that for every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, a 1.61% (95% CI = 0.87, 2.35%) increase in respiratory admissions followed over a 5-day cumulative lag. Our estimates show that a 10 μg/m3 reduction in average exposure will potentially avert 391 yearly respiratory admissions (95% CI = 211,571), with 265 fewer admissions among Kuwaitis (95% CI = 139,393) and 262 fewer admissions among children under 15 years of age (95% CI = 125,351). Different strata of the Kuwaiti population are vulnerable to respiratory hospitalization with short-term exposure to PM2.5, especially those under 15 years of age. The findings are informative for public health authorities in Kuwait and other dust-prone countries.",

Using source-specific PM2.5 concentrations at six urban sites in New York State, a case-crossover design, and conditional logistic regression, we examined the association between source-specific PM and the rate of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for influenza or culture-negative pneumonia from 2005 to 2016. There were at most N = 14 764 influenza hospitalizations, N = 57 522 influenza ED visits, N = 274 226 culture-negative pneumonia hospitalizations, and N = 113 997 culture-negative pneumonia ED visits included in our analyses. We separately estimated the rate of respiratory infection associated with increased concentrations of source-specific PM2.5, including secondary sulfate (SS), secondary nitrate (SN), biomass burning (BB), pyrolyzed organic carbon (OP), road dust (RD), residual oil (RO), diesel (DIE), and spark ignition vehicle emissions (GAS). Increased rates of ED visits for influenza were associated with interquartile range increases in concentrations of GAS (excess rate [ER] = 9.2%; 95% CI: 4.3%, 14.3%) and DIE (ER = 3.9%; 95% CI: 1.1%, 6.8%) for lag days 0-3. There were similar associations between BB, SS, OP, and RO, and ED visits or hospitalizations for influenza, but not culture-negative pneumonia hospitalizations or ED visits. Short-term increases in PM2.5 from traffic and other combustion sources appear to be a potential risk factor for increased rates of influenza hospitalizations and ED visits.",

      "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the associations between air pollution and emergency hospital visits for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the arid regions of northwest China. We collected daily emergency department (ED) visits for URTI from three hospitals in Lanzhou during January 2014 and December 2018, as well as daily air pollutants and meteorological factors. In the present study, generalized additive model with quasi-Poisson regression was used to evaluate the relationship between short-term exposure to ambient pollutants and daily emergency hospital visits for URTI in Lanzhou, China. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted by gender (male and female), age (0-14, 15-64, and ≥ 65 years)), and season (cold season, warm season). The results of the single-pollutant model show that the associations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO with URTI ED visits were all statistically significant, whereas we observed insignificant associations of O38h. The highest association of each pollutant with hospital emergency visits was observed with PM2.5 (5.302% (95% CI: 3.202, 7.445)), PM10 (0.808% (95% CI: 0.291, 1.328)), SO2 (10.607% (95% CI: 5.819, 15.611)), and NO2 (5.325% (95% CI: 2.379, 8.357)) at lag 07 for an increase of 10 ug/m3 in concentrations of the pollutants. Percentage increase for each 1-mg/m3 increase in CO was 20.799% (95% CI: 11.834, 30.482) at lag 07. In the stratification analyses, females were more susceptible to PM2.5 and PM10, while males were more sensitive to the effects of SO2, NO2, and CO, and the higher association effect of four pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO) on hospital visits for URTI among children (0-14 years). The associations appeared to be stronger in the cool season than in the warm season. This study suggests that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to SO2 and CO, was associated with increased risk of hospital emergency visits for URTI in Lanzhou, China. Relevant strategies and health interventions should be strengthened to reduce the air pollution level in the future.",

We investigated the relationship between rates of hospitalization of children aged under 5 years for pneumonia and asthma and the concentration of air pollutants in Ningbo between January 1, 2015 and August 29, 2017. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Ningbo Air Quality Data Real-time Publishing System and the big data platform of the Ningbo Health Information Center. A generalized additive model was established via logarithmic link function and utilized to evaluate the effect of pollutant concentration on lag dimension and perform sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 10,301 cases of pneumonia and 115 cases of asthma were identified over the course of this study. Results revealed that PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were significantly associated with hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma in children under 5 years of age. For every 10-unit increase in lag03 air pollutant concentration, hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma due to PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increased by 2.22% (95%CI: 0.64%, 3.82%), 1.94% (95%CI: 0.85%, 3.04%), 11.21% (95%CI: 4.70%, 18.10%) and 5.42% (95%CI: 3.07%, 7.82%), respectively. DISCUSSION: Adverse effects of air pollutants were found to be more severe in children aged 1 to 5 years and adverse effects due to PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 were found to be more severe in girls. Our findings underscore the need for implementation of effective public health measures to urgently improve air quality and reduce pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory illness.",

      "abstract": "In order to examine associations between asthma morbidity and local ambient air pollution in an area with relatively low levels of pollution, we conducted a time-series analysis of asthma hospital admissions and fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) in and around Jackson, MS, for the period 2003 to 2011. Daily patient-level records were obtained from the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) Asthma Surveillance System. Patient geolocations were aggregated into a grid with 0.1° × 0.1° resolution within the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area. Daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated via machine-learning algorithms with remotely sensed aerosol optical depth and other associated parameters as inputs. Controlling for long-term temporal trends and meteorology, we estimated a 7.2% (95% confidence interval 1.7-13.1%) increase in daily all-age asthma emergency room admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in the 3-day average of PM2.5 levels (current day and two prior days). Stratified analyses reveal significant associations between asthma and 3-day average PM2.5 for males and blacks. Our results contribute to the current epidemiologic evidence on the association between acute ambient air pollution exposure and asthma morbidity, even in an area characterized by relatively good air quality.",

      "abstract": "Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) lead to increased morbidity and premature deaths, imposing a significant burden on public health worldwide. Recently, several studies have linked ambient air pollution with the acute exacerbation of certain ILDs, but the evidence remains limited and inconclusive. With a multicenter hospital-based case-crossover design, we investigated 9128 patients who resided in Jiangsu province, China, and were admitted for ILDs between 2019 and 2022. Residential exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5), PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) was assessed using our validated grid datasets. We fitted conditional logistic regression models to examine associations of exposure to air pollutants with ILD admission. A 10 µg/m3 increment of exposure to SO2 and NO2 was positively associated with a 16.18 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3.79 %, 30.03 %) and 4.06 % (0.75 %, 7.49 %) increase in odds of ILD admission, respectively. All these associations appeared to be linear and the association of SO2 exposure was significantly stronger among older adults. We estimated that over 10 % of ILD admissions could be attributable to exposure to SO2 and NO2. This study provides compelling evidence on the association of exposure to ambient air pollutants (including SO2 and NO2) with an increased odds of ILD hospitalizations. Our findings indicate that SO2 and NO2 exposures can lead to the exacerbation of ILDs, especially in elderly, and that the disease burden is considerable.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to study the effect of air pollution and noise has on the population in Madrid Community (MAR) in the period 2013-2018, and its economic impact. METHODS: Time series study analysing emergency hospital admissions in the MAR due to all causes (ICD-10: A00-R99), respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) and circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) across the period 2013-2018. The main independent variables were mean daily PM2.5, PM10, NO2, 8-h ozone concentrations, and noise. We controlled for meteorological variables, Public Holidays, seasonality, and the trend and autoregressive nature of the series, and fitted generalised linear models with a Poisson regression link to ascertain the relative risks and attributable risks. In addition, we made an economic assessment of these hospitalisations. RESULTS: The following associations were found: NO2 with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.007, 95% CI: 1.004-1.011) and respiratory causes (RR: 1.012, 95% CI: 1.005-1.019); 8-h ozone with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.049, 95% CI: 1.014-1.046) and circulatory causes (RR: 1.088, 95% CI: 1.039-1.140); and diurnal noise (LAeq7-23h) with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001-1.002), respiratory (RR: 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001-1.003) and circulatory causes (RR: 1.003, 95% CI: 1.002-1.005). Every year, a total of 8246 (95% CI: 4580-11,905) natural-cause admissions are attributable to NO2, with an estimated cost of close on €120 million and 5685 (95% CI: 2533-8835) attributed to LAeq7-23h with an estimated cost of close on €82 million. CONCLUSIONS: Nitrogen dioxide, ozone and noise are the main pollutants to which a large number of hospitalisations in the MAR are attributed, and are thus responsible for a marked deterioration in population health and high related economic impact.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of the global economy and the acceleration of urbanization, air pollution has become a major environmental problem threatening human health. There is limited evidence on the acute effects of air pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: From 2014 to 2019, we collected data on daily admissions for COPD patients from a city in China. We used the generalized additive model together with distributed lag models to fit the associations of air pollutants with hospital admissions. RESULTS: We observed significant increments in the number of daily admissions (0.086-0.109%) for COPD for a unit range increase in air quality index, PM2.5 and PM10 over four lag days. The impact of air pollution on the number of daily admissions was mainly reflected in the COPD patients who were hospitalized through outpatient departments and tertiary hospitals. DISCUSSION: Short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution may induce the occurrence or exacerbation of COPD patients; therefore, government departments should strengthen the management of air pollution, improve supervision and control mechanisms, pay attention to the quality of medical services, and reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on patients' health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The associations between fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) air pollution and hospital admissions for full-spectrum respiratory diseases were rarely investigated, especially for age-specific associations. We aim to estimate the age-specific associations of short-term exposures to PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 with hospital admissions for full-spectrum respiratory diseases in China. METHODS: We conducted an individual-level case-crossover study based on a nationwide hospital-based registry including 153 hospitals across 20 provincial regions in China in 2013-20. We applied conditional logistic regression models and distributed lag models to estimate the exposure- and lag-response associations. RESULTS: A total of 1 399 955 hospital admission records for various respiratory diseases were identified. The associations of PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 with total respiratory hospitalizations lasted for 4 days, and an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 (34.5 μg/m3) and PM2.5-10 (26.0 μg/m3) was associated with 1.73% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.34%, 2.12%)] and 1.70% (95% CI: 1.31%, 2.10%) increases, respectively, in total respiratory hospitalizations over lag 0-4 days. Acute respiratory infections (i.e. pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis) were consistently associated with PM2.5 or PM2.5-10 exposure across different age groups. We found the disease spectrum varied by age, including rarely reported findings (i.e. acute laryngitis and tracheitis, and influenza) among children and well-established associations (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute bronchitis and emphysema) among older populations. Besides, the associations were stronger in females, children and older populations. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide case-crossover study provides robust evidence that short-term exposure to both PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 was associated with increased hospital admissions for a wide range of respiratory diseases, and the spectra of respiratory diseases varied by age. Females, children and older populations were more susceptible.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Exposure to air pollutants is one of the factors responsible for hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases. The objective here was to estimate the effect of exposure to particulate matter (such as PM2.5) on hospitalizations due to certain respiratory diseases among residents in Volta Redonda (RJ). DESIGN AND SETTING: Ecological time series study using data from Volta Redonda (RJ). METHODS: Data on hospital admissions among residents of Volta Redonda (RJ), between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, due to pneumonia, acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma, were analyzed. Daily data on PM2.5 concentrations were estimated through the CCATT-BRAMS model. The generalized additive Poisson regression model was used, taking the daily number of hospitalizations to be the dependent variable and the PM2.5 concentration to be the independent variable, with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity, seasonality and day of the week, and using lags of zero to seven days. Excess hospitalization and its cost were calculated in accordance with increases in PM2.5 concentration of 5 µg/m3. RESULTS: There were 752 hospitalizations in 2012; the average concentration of PM2.5 was 17.2 µg/m3; the effects of exposure were significant at lag 2 (RR = 1.017), lag 5 (RR = 1.022) and lag 7 (RR = 1,020). A decrease in PM2.5 concentration of 5 µg/m3 could reduce admissions by up to 76 cases, with a decrease in spending of R$ 84,000 a year. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study provide support for implementing public health policies in this municipality, which is an important steelmaking center. CONTEXTO E OBJETIVO:: A exposição aos poluentes do ar é um dos fatores responsáveis por internações por doenças respiratórias; o objetivo foi estimar o efeito da exposição a material particulado (como PM2,5) sobre as hospitalizações devido a certas doenças respiratórias em moradores de Volta Redonda (RJ). TIPO DE ESTUDO E LOCAL:: Estudo ecológico de séries temporais utilizando dados de Volta Redonda (RJ). MÉTODOS:: Foram analisados dados de internação hospitalar, entre 1 de janeiro de 2012 e 31 de dezembro de 2012, devida a pneumonia, bronquite aguda, bronquiolite e asma, em residentes em Volta Redonda (RJ), e dados diários das concentrações de PM2,5 obtidos a partir do modelo CCATT-BRAMS. Utilizou-se o modelo aditivo generalizado de regressão de Poisson, sendo o número diário de internações a variável dependente e a concentração PM2,5 a variável independente, ajustado para temperatura, umidade relativa, sazonalidade e dia da semana e defasagens entre zero e sete dias. Excesso de internação hospitalar e seu custo, de acordo com o aumento de 5 ug/m3 na concentração de PM2,5, foram calculados. RESULTADOS:: Ocorreram 752 internações em 2012; a concentração média de PM2,5 foi de 17,2 ug/m3; os efeitos da exposição foram significativos em lag 2 (RR = 1,017), lag 5 (RR = 1,022) e lag 7 (RR = 1,020). A redução em 5 ug/m3 na concentração de PM2,5 poderia reduzir até 76 casos as internações com diminuição nos gastos de R$ 84 mil/ano.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and acute respiratory infection in children are scarce and present inconsistent results. We estimated the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and acute respiratory infection among children aged 0-4 years using a difference-in-differences approach. METHODS: We used data on the daily PM2.5 concentrations, hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection, and meteorological factors of the 15 regions in the Republic of Korea (2013-2015). To estimate the cumulative effects, we used a difference-in-differences approach generalized to multiple spatial units (regions) and time periods (day) with distributed lag non-linear models. RESULTS: With PM2.5 levels of 20.0 μg/m3 as a reference, PM2.5 levels of 30.0 μg/m3 were positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (relative risk (RR) = 1.048, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.028, 1.069) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.060, 95% CI: 1.038, 1.082) but not with the risk of acute lower respiratory infection and pneumonia. PM2.5 levels of 40.0 μg/m3 were also positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (RR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.046, 1.122) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.094, 95% CI: 1.054, 1.136). CONCLUSIONS: We found the associations of short-term PM2.5 exposure with acute upper respiratory infection and bronchitis or bronchiolitis among children aged 0-4 years. As causal inference methods can provide more convincing evidence of the effects of PM2.5 levels on respiratory infections, public health policies and guidelines regarding PM2.5 need to be strengthened accordingly.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that ambient air pollution is a major risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations and emergencies. The objective of this study was to determine the association between ambient air pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory conditions in nine districts across the province of Ontario in Canada. Health, air pollutant (PM2.5, NO2, O3, and SO2), and meteorological data were retrieved from April 2004 to December 2011. Respiratory diseases were categorized as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchiectasis) and acute upper respiratory diseases. A case-crossover design was used to test the associations between ED visits and ambient air pollutants, stratified by sex and season. For COPD among males, positive results were observed for NO2 with lags of 3-6 days, for PM2.5 with lags 1-8, and for SO2 with lags of 4-8 days. For COPD among females, positive results were observed for O3 with lags 2-4 days, and for SO2 among lags of 3-6 days. For upper respiratory disease emergencies among males, positive results were observed for NO2 (lags 5-8 days), for O3, (lags 0-6 days), PM2.5 (all lags), and SO2 (lag 8), and among females, positive results were observed for NO2 for lag 8 days, for O3, PM2.5 among all lags. Our study provides evidence of the associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and increased risk of ED visits for upper and lower respiratory diseases in an environment where air pollutant concentrations are relatively low.",

      "title": "The association between fine particulate matter and acute lower respiratory infections in Yancheng City, China.",
      "abstract": "Due to the rapid economic development and acceleration of industrialization, most cities in China are experiencing severe air pollution. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). To estimate associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and ALRI hospitalization in Yancheng City, China. This was a 6-year time-series study from 2014 to 2019. Data on hospitalization were collected from four high-ranked general hospitals, including for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis (AEB), and the sum was termed total ALRIs. We obtained pollutant exposure data from five fixed monitoring stations. The association between PM2.5 and ALRI hospitalization was estimated using the generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson regression. Two-pollutant models were applied to test the robustness of the observed correlations. Subgroup analyses included sex, age, and season. During the study period, a total of 43,283 cases of total ALRIs were recorded. The average annual mean PM2.5 concentration was 45.4 ± 32.3 μg/m3. A 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration (lag 0) was significantly associated with increases in hospitalizations for total ALRIs (at 0.73%; 95% CI: 0.40%, 1.06%), in CAP (at 0.80%; 95% CI: 0.02%, 1.57%), in for AECOPD (1.08%; 95% CI: 0.38%, 1.78%), and AECB (0.67%; 95% CI: 0.23%, 1.11%). The estimated effects for total ALRIs and AECB were relatively robust with adjustment for other air pollutants. Associations between PM2.5 and total ALRIs were stronger in females, in the elderly, and in the cold season. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with ALRI morbidity, and females and older people were more susceptible to PM2.5 air pollution, especially in the cold season.",

      "title": "Ambient air pollution and cause-specific risk of hospital admission in China: A nationwide time-series study.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impacts of air pollution on circulatory and respiratory systems have been extensively studied. However, the associations between air pollution exposure and the risk of noncommunicable diseases of other organ systems, including diseases of the digestive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary systems, remain unclear or inconclusive. We aimed to systematically assess the associations between short-term exposure to main air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM2.5] and ozone) and cause-specific risk of hospital admission in China over a wide spectrum of human diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Daily data on hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of 14 major and 188 minor disease categories in 252 Chinese cities (107 cities in North China and 145 cities in South China) from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017, were obtained from the Hospital Quality Monitoring System of China (covering 387 hospitals in North China and 614 hospitals in South China). We applied a 2-stage analytic approach to assess the associations between air pollution and daily hospital admissions. City-specific associations were estimated with quasi-Poisson regression models and then pooled by random-effects meta-analyses. Each disease category was analyzed separately, and the P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. A total of 117,338,867 hospital admissions were recorded in the study period. Overall, 51.7% of the hospitalized cases were male, and 71.3% were aged <65 years. Robust positive associations were found between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospital admissions for 7 major disease categories: (1) endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases; (2) nervous diseases; (3) circulatory diseases; (4) respiratory diseases; (5) digestive diseases; (6) musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases; and (7) genitourinary diseases. For example, a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.21% (95% CI 0.15% to 0.27%; adjusted P < 0.001) increase in hospital admissions for diseases of the digestive system on the same day in 2-pollutant models (adjusting for ozone). There were 35 minor disease categories significantly positively associated with same-day PM2.5 in both single- and 2-pollutant models, including diabetes mellitus, anemia, intestinal infection, liver diseases, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal failure, urinary tract calculus, chronic ulcer of skin, and back problems. The association between short-term ozone exposure and respiratory diseases was robust. No safety threshold in the exposure-response relationships between PM2.5 and hospital admissions was observed. The main limitations of the present study included the unavailability of data on personal air pollution exposures. CONCLUSIONS: In the Chinese population during 2013-2017, short-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM2.5, was associated with increased risk of hospitalization for diseases of multiple organ systems, including certain diseases of the digestive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary systems; many of these associations are important but still not fully recognized. The effect estimates and exposure-response relationships can inform policy making aimed at protecting public health from air pollution in China.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested the effects of ambient fine particles (PM2.5) on asthma, but the effects of specific components of PM2.5 on asthma remain to be explored. Here, we studied the effect of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on asthma acute exacerbation. The data on daily counts of emergency room visits (ERVs) were obtained from Wan Fang Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, from 2012 to 2015. The daily concentrations of PM2.5 and pollutant gases were obtained from a local air quality monitoring station. The levels of PM2.5-bound PAH were estimated by an established grid-scale model. Relative risks for ERVs as the increase in the level of ambient pollutants were calculated by using a generalized additive model of Poisson regression. In the present study, we observed statistically significant positive associations between PM2.5 and asthma ERVs for all age groups. PM2.5-bound PAH was also associated with asthma ERVs for all age groups. In the adult subgroup analysis, there was a significant association between PM2.5-bound PAH and asthma ERVs at lags 1 and 2 (RR 1.289, 95% CI 1.050-1.582 and RR 1.242, 95% CI 1.039-1.485). The impacts of air pollution on the risk of pediatric asthma ERV were found to be significant for PM2.5 at lag day 0 (RR 1.310, 95% CI 1.069-1.606). Moreover, pediatric asthma ERVs were significantly associated with the levels of PM2.5-bound PAH at lag 1 and 2 days (RR 1.576, 95% CI 1.371-1.810 and RR 1.426, 95% CI 1.265-1.607). The study provides evidence that PM2.5-bound PAHs were associated with an increased risk of asthma attacks. Our data further suggested that traffic exhaust is a primary source of PM2.5-bound PAHs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies on the association between short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) with hospital admission in major cities in China were limited to shorter study periods or a single hospital. The aim of this ecological study based on a 12.5-year time series was to investigate the association of short-term exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases. METHODS: Daily hospital admissions data were from the Shanghai Medical Insurance System for the period January 1, 2008 to July 31, 2020. We estimated the percentage change with its 95% confidence interval (CI) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in the level of PM2.5 and PM10 after adjustment for calendar time, day of the week, public holidays, and meteorological factors applying a generalized additive model with a quasi-Poisson distribution. RESULTS: There were 1,960,361 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Shanghai during the study period. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the level of each class of PM was associated with increased total respiratory diseases when the lag time was 0 day (PM2.5: 0.755%; 95% CI: 0.422, 1.089%; PM10: 0.250%; 95% CI: 0.042, 0.459%). The PM2.5 and PM10 levels also had positive associations with admissions for COPD, asthma, and pneumonia. Stratified analyses demonstrated stronger effects in patients more than 45 years old and during the cold season. Total respiratory diseases increased linearly with PM concentration from 0 to 100 μg/m3, and increased more slowly at higher PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This time-series study suggests that short-term exposure to PM increased the risk for hospital admission for respiratory diseases, even at low concentrations. These findings suggest that reducing atmospheric PM concentrations may reduce hospital admissions for respiratory diseases.",

METHODS: Daily number of AEDv, air pollution levels (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO) and meteorological variables was obtained from Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia, for the period of 2007-11. Data were analyzed using a time-series approach. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The associations between AEDv and PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 remained positive and statistically significant after mutual adjustment in the multi-pollutant model.The RR of AEDv increased by 5.4, 4.4, 3.4 and 2.2% per an inter-quartile range increase in SO2 (2.0 ppb), PM2.5 (36 μg/m3), NO2 (7.6 ppb) and PM10 (140 μg/m3), respectively. No significant associations between AEDv and CO were found. CONCLUSIONS: Current levels of ambient air pollution are associated with AEDv in this industrial setting in the Middle East. Greater awareness of environmental health protection and the implementation of effective measures to improve the quality of air in such settings would be beneficial to public health.",

      "title": "Asthma morbidity and ambient air pollution: effect modification by residential traffic-related air pollution.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution has been associated with asthma-related hospital admissions and emergency department visits (hospital encounters). We hypothesized that higher individual exposure to residential traffic-related air pollutants would enhance these associations. METHODS: We studied 11,390 asthma-related hospital encounters among 7492 subjects 0-18 years of age living in Orange County, California. Ambient exposures were measured at regional air monitoring stations. Seasonal average traffic-related exposures (PM2.5, ultrafine particles, NOx, and CO) were estimated near subjects' geocoded residences for 6-month warm and cool seasonal periods, using dispersion models based on local traffic within 500 m radii. Associations were tested in case-crossover conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature and humidity. We assessed effect modification by seasonal residential traffic-related air pollution exposures above and below median dispersion-modeled exposures. Secondary analyses considered effect modification by traffic exposures within race/ethnicity and insurance group strata. RESULTS: Asthma morbidity was positively associated with daily ambient O3 and PM2.5 in warm seasons and with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 in cool seasons. Associations with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 were stronger among subjects living at residences with above-median traffic-related exposures, especially in cool seasons. Secondary analyses showed no consistent differences in association, and 95% confidence intervals were wide, indicating a lack of precision for estimating these highly stratified associations. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of asthma with ambient air pollution were enhanced among subjects living in homes with high traffic-related air pollution. This may be because of increased susceptibility (greater asthma severity) or increased vulnerability (meteorologic amplification of local vs. correlated ambient exposures).",

      "title": "Risks of hospital admissions from a spectrum of causes associated with particulate matter pollution.",
      "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution has been linked to elevated hospital admissions (HAs), especially from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have estimated the associations between PM pollution and HAs for a wider range of broad disease categories. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ≤10 μm (PM10) on a range of broad and specific causes of HAs in Chengdu, China during 2015-2016, using a generalized additive model (GAM). Age-, gender- and season-specific analyses were also performed on the broad categories. We further calculated the corresponding morbidity burden due to PM exposure. During the study period, the daily mean level for PM2.5 and PM10 was 57.3 μg/m3 and 94.7 μg/m3, respectively. For broad disease categories, each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 at lag06 was associated with increments of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.32%-0.99%) in HAs from respiratory, 0.49% (95% CI: 0.04%-0.95%) from circulatory and 0.91% (95% CI: 0.15%-1.69%) from skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases. By contrast, only respiratory HAs showed a significant positive association with elevated PM2.5 at lag06 (1.03% increase per 10 μg/m3, 95% CI: 0.50%-1.56%, p < 0.001). Increased HAs risks for several more refined specific causes within respiratory, circulatory, skin and subcutaneous tissue, nervous and genitourinary diseases were also observed. Subgroup analyses indicated that effect estimates were modified by age, gender and season. Overall, the largest morbidity burden was observed in myocardial infarction, about 11.27% (95% CI: 3.45%-18.07%) and 11.11% (95% CI: 4.07%-17.27%) of HAs for myocardial infarction could be attributable to PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeding the WHO's air quality guidelines (24-h mean: 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 50 μg/m3 for PM10). Our study suggests that both PM2.5 and PM10 increase risks of morbidity from broad range of causes of HAs in Chengdu, and result in substantial morbidity burden.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to ambient particulate matter is associated with adverse health effects. Little is known, however, about which components of the particulate mixture (size, number, source, toxicity) are most relevant to health. We investigated associations of a range of particle metrics with daily deaths and hospital admissions in London. METHODS: Daily concentrations of particle mass (PM10, PM2.5, and PM(10-2.5)), measured using gravimetric, tapered-element-oscillating, and filter-dynamic-measurement-system samplers, as well as particle number concentration and particle composition (carbon, sulfate, nitrate and chloride), were collected from a background monitoring station in central London between 2000 and 2005. All-cause and cause-specific deaths and emergency admissions to hospital in London for the same period were also collected. A Poisson regression time-series model was used in the analysis. RESULTS: The results were not consistent across the various outcomes and lags. Particle number concentration was associated with daily mortality and admissions, particularly for cardiovascular diseases lagged 1-day; increases in particle number concentration (10,166 n/cm3) were associated with 2.2% (95% confidence interval = 0.6% to 3.8%) and 0.6% (-0.4% to 1.7%) increases in cardiovascular deaths and admissions, respectively. Secondary pollutants, especially nonprimary PM2.5, nitrate and sulfate, were more important for respiratory outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidence that specific components of the particle mixture for air pollutants may be relevant to specific diseases. Interpretation should be cautious, however, in particular because exposures were based upon data from a single centrally located monitoring site. There is a need for replication with more comprehensive exposure data, both in London and elsewhere.",

      "title": "Effects of ambient air pollution on cause-specific hospitalizations in Wuhan during 2017-2019.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the associations between air pollutants and multiple organ system diseases in the entire hospitalized population. The present study aims to explore the short-term effects of six routinely monitored air pollutants on the broad causes of hospital admissions and estimate the resulting hospital admission burdens. METHODS: Daily hospital admission records from 2017 to 2019 were obtained from the Wuhan Information center of Health and Family Planning. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were employed to evaluate the effects of air pollutants on the percent increase in the cause-specific daily number of hospital admissions. Increased hospital admission numbers, days, and expenses were also estimated. RESULTS: A total of 2636,026 hospital admissions were identified. We found that both PM2.5 and PM10 increased the risk of hospital admissions for most disease categories. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with hospitalizations of several rarely studied disease categories, such as diseases of the eye and adnexa (2.83%, 95%CI: 0.96-4.73%, P < 0.01) and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (2.17%, 95% CI: 0.88-3.47%, P < 0.001). NO2 was observed to have a robust effect on diseases of the respiratory system (1.36%, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98%, P < 0.001). CO was significantly associated with hospital admissions for six disease categories. Furthermore, each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 13,444 hospital admissions (95% CI: 6239-20,649), 124,344 admission days (95% CI: 57,705-190,983), and 166-million-yuan admission expenses (95% CI: 77-255). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that particulate matter (PM) had a short-term effect on hospital admissions of most major disease categories and resulted in a considerable hospital admission burden. In addition, the health effects of NO2 and CO emissions require more attention in megacities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rising pollution plays a crucial role in worsening several respiratory diseases. Particulate Matter (PM)-induced asthma exacerbations are one of the most dangerous events. OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between progressive particulate matter short-term exposure and asthma exacerbations, we investigated the role of PM levels on Emergency Department (ED) admissions and hospitalizations for these events in Brescia, an important industrial city located in northern Italy with high yearly levels of air pollution. METHODS: We analyzed 1050 clinical records of ED admissions for suspected asthma exacerbation, starting from January 2014 to December 2017. Daily PM levels were collected from the Environmental Protection Regional Agency. We performed a time-series analysis using a Poisson regression model with single and multiple day-lag. Results were expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and Excess of Relative Risk (ERR) of severe asthma exacerbation over a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5 concentration. RESULTS: We selected and focused our analysis on 543 admissions for indisputable asthma exacerbation in ED and hospital. The time-series study showed an increase of the RR (CI95%) for asthma exacerbation-related ED admissions of 1.24 with an ERR of 24.2% for PM2.5 at lag0-1 (p < 0.05). We also estimated for PM2.5 a RR (CI95%) of 1.12 with an ERR of 12.5% at lag0-5 (p ≤ 0.05). Again, for PM2.5, an increase of the RR (CI95%) for asthma exacerbation-related hospitalizations of 1.31 with an ERR of 30.7% at lag0-1 (p < 0.05) has been documented. These findings were confirmed and even reinforced considering only the population living in the city. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PM exposure, especially for PM2.5, plays a critical role in inducing asthma exacerbation events leading to ED admission or hospitalization.",

      "title": "Associations of Emergency Department Visits for Asthma with Precipitation and Temperature on Thunderstorm Days: A Time-Series Analysis of Data from Louisiana, USA, 2010-2012.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of thunderstorm asthma to understand risk factors using high-resolution climate data and asthma outcomes on a large scale are scarce. Moreover, thunderstorm asthma is not well studied in the United States. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether climate parameters involved in thunderstorms are associated with emergency department (ED) visits for acute asthma attacks in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed 63,789 asthma-related, daily ED visits for all age groups, and thunderstorm-associated climate data in Louisiana during 2010 through 2012. We performed time-series analyses using quasi-Poisson regression models with natural cubic splines of date, parish, holiday, day of week, season, daily maximum concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter [PM ≤2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)], and daily mean pressure, precipitation, and temperature. Because of a significant interaction effect between temperature and lightning days on asthma-related visits, we performed stratified analyses by days with/without lightning or thunderstorm (defined by any lightning and precipitation). RESULTS: On thunderstorm days, higher asthma-related ED visits were associated with higher daily mean precipitation [relative risk (RR)=1.145 per 1 g/m2/s (95% CI: 1.009, 1.300)] and lower daily mean temperature [RR=1.011 per 1°C change (1.000-1.021)] without carry-over effect to the next non-thunderstorm day. These higher risks were found mainly among children and adults <65 years of age. We observed similar results on lightning days. However, we did not find similar associations for non-thunderstorm or non-lightning days. Daily maximum O3 and PM2.5 levels were not significantly associated with asthma ED visits on thunderstorm days. DISCUSSION: Higher precipitation and lower temperature on thunderstorm days appear to contribute to asthma attacks among people with asthma, suggesting they should consider taking precautions during thunderstorms. EDs should consider preparing for a potential increase of asthma-related visits and ensuring sufficient stock of emergency medication and supplies for forecasted severe thunderstorm days. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10440.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are few studies on the effects of air pollutants on acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) in children. Here, we investigated the relationship of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the daily number of hospitalizations for ALRI in children in Sichuan Province, China, and to estimate the economic burden of disease due to exposure to air pollutants. METHODS: We collected records of 192,079 cases of childhood ALRI hospitalization between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018 from nine municipal/prefecture medical institutions as well as the simultaneous meteorological and air pollution data from 183 monitoring sites in Sichuan Province. A time series-generalized additive model was used to analyze exposure responses and lagged effects while assessing the economic burden caused by air pollutant exposure after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, day of the week, and meteorological factors. RESULTS: Our single-pollutant model shows that for each 10 μg/m3 increase in air pollutant concentration (1 μg/m3 for SO2), the effect estimates of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 for pneumonia reached their maximum at lag4, lag010, lag010, and lag07, respectively, with relative risk (RR) values of 1.0064 (95% CI, 1.0004-1.0124), 1.0168(95% CI 1.0089-1.0248), 1.0278 (95% CI 1.0157-1.0400), and 1.0378 (95% CI, 1.0072-1.0692). By contrast, the effect estimates of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 for bronchitis all reached their maximum at lag010, with RRs of 1.0133 (95% CI 1.0025-1.0242), 1.0161(95% CI 1.0085-1.0238), 1.0135 (95% CI 1.0025-1.0247), and 1.1133(95% CI 1.0739-1.1541). In addition, children aged 5-14 years were more vulnerable to air pollutants than those aged 0-4 years (p < 0.05). According to the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines, the number of ALRI hospitalizations attributed to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 pollution during the study period was 7551, 10,151, and 7575, respectively, while the incurring economic burden was CNY 2847.06, 3827.27, and 2855.91 million. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in Sichuan Province, elevated daily average concentrations of four air pollutants lead to increases in numbers of childhood ALRI hospitalizations and cause a serious economic burden.",

We obtained data on pollutants-PM10, PM2.5-in Seoul, South Korea. We also investigated data for asthma and COPD exacerbation that required hospitalization from 2006 to 2016. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design and generalized additive models with log transformation to assess adjusted risk, and conditional logistic regression was performed to analyze these data. Our study showed that PM10 and PM2.5, on different best lag days, were associated with increased risks of COPD or asthma hospitalization. The odds ratios (ORs) for each per-unit increase in PM10 and PM2.5 were higher in patients with male asthma (PM10: OR, 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.008-1.016 and PM2.5: OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1008-1.023), preschool asthma (PM10: OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.006-1.015 and PM2.5: OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.009-1.024), male COPD (PM10: OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.005-1.019 and PM2.5: OR, 1.013; 95% CI, 1.000-1.026), and senior COPD (PM10: OR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.008-1.024 and PM2.5: OR, 1.022; 95% CI, 1.007-1.036).

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Evidence of short-term effects of ultrafine particles (UFP) on health is still inconsistent and few multicenter studies have been conducted so far especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: Within the UFIREG project, we investigated the short-term effects of UFP and fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) on daily cause-specific hospital admissions in five Central and Eastern European cities using harmonized protocols for measurements and analyses. METHODS: Daily counts of cause-specific hospital admissions focusing on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were obtained for Augsburg and Dresden (Germany), 2011-2012; Chernivtsi (Ukraine), 2013 to March 2014; and Ljubljana (Slovenia) and Prague (Czech Republic), 2012-2013. Air pollution and meteorologic data were measured at fixed monitoring sites in all cities. We analyzed city-specific associations using confounder-adjusted Poisson regression models and pooled the city-specific effect estimates using metaanalysis methods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 2,750 particles/cm3 increase (average interquartile range across all cities) in the 6-day average of UFP indicated a delayed and prolonged increase in the pooled relative risk of respiratory hospital admissions (3.4% [95% confidence interval, -1.7 to 8.8%]). We also found increases in the pooled relative risk of cardiovascular (exposure average of lag 2-5, 1.8% [0.1-3.4%]) and respiratory (6-d average exposure, 7.5% [4.9-10.2%]) admissions per 12.4 μg/m3 increase (average interquartile range) in PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated delayed and prolonged effects of UFP exposure on respiratory hospital admissions in Central and Eastern Europe. Cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions increased in association with an increase in PM2.5. Further multicenter studies are needed using harmonized UFP measurements to draw definite conclusions on health effects of UFP.",

      "abstract": "Ambient air pollution exposure is associated with exacerbating respiratory illnesses. Race/ethnicity (R/E) have been shown to influence an individual's vulnerability to environmental health risks such as fine particles (PM 2.5). This study aims to assess the R/E disparities in vulnerability to air pollution with regards to respiratory hospital admissions in San Diego County, California where most days fall below National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for daily PM 2.5 concentrations. Daily PM 2.5 levels were estimated at the zip code level using a spatial interpolation using inverse-distance weighting from monitor networks. The association between daily PM 2.5 levels and respiratory hospital admissions in San Diego County over a 15-year period from 1999 to 2013 was assessed with a time-series analysis using a multi-level Poisson regression model. Cochran Q tests were used to assess the effect modification of race/ethnicity on this association. Daily fine particle levels varied greatly from 1 μg/m3 to 75.86 μg/m3 (SD = 6.08 μg/m3) with the majority of days falling below 24-hour NAAQS for PM 2.5 of 35 μg/m3. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM 2.5 levels, Black and White individuals had higher rates (8.6% and 6.2%, respectively) of hospitalization for respiratory admissions than observed in the county as a whole (4.1%). Increases in PM 2.5 levels drive an overall increase in respiratory hospital admissions with a disparate burden of health effects by R/E group. These findings suggest an opportunity to design interventions that address the unequal burden of air pollution among vulnerable communities in San Diego County that exist even below NAAQS for daily PM 2.5 concentrations.",

We assessed the associations between low-level PM2.5 exposure and cardiorespiratory admissions in Japan. We collected the daily hospital admission count data, air pollutant data, and meteorological condition data recorded from April 2016 to March 2019 in 139 Japanese cities. City-specific estimates were obtained from conditional logistic regression models in a time-stratified case-crossover design and pooled by random-effect models. We estimated that every 10-μg/m3 increase in the concurrent-day PM2.5 concentration was related to a 0.52% increase in cardiovascular admissions (95% CI: 0.13-0.92%) and a 1.74% increase in respiratory admissions (95% CI: 1.41-2.07%). These values were nearly the same when the datasets were filtered to contain only daily PM2.5 concentrations <15 μg/m3. The exposure-response curves showed approximately sublinear-to-linear curves with no indication of thresholds. These associations with cardiovascular diseases weakened after adjusting for nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide, but associations with respiratory diseases were almost unchanged when additionally adjusted for other pollutants. This study demonstrated that associations between daily PM2.5 and daily cardiorespiratory hospitalizations might persist at low concentrations, including those below the latest WHO AQG value. Our findings suggest that the updated guideline value may still be insufficient from the perspective of public health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Positive associations between ambient PM2.5 and cardiorespiratory disease have been well demonstrated during the past decade. However, few studies have examined the adverse effects of PM2.5 based on an entire population of a megalopolis. In addition, most studies in China have used averaged data, which results in variations between monitoring and personal exposure values, creating an inherent and unavoidable type of measurement error. METHODS: This study was conducted in Wuhan, a megacity in central China with about 10.9 million people. Daily hospital admission records, from October 2016 to December 2018, were obtained from the Wuhan Information center of Health and Family Planning, which administrates all hospitals in Wuhan. Daily air pollution concentrations and weather variables in Wuhan during the study period were collected. We developed a land use regression model (LUR) to assess individual PM2.5 exposure. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate cardiorespiratory hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5. We also conducted stratification analyses by age, sex, and season. RESULTS: A total of 2,806,115 hospital admissions records were collected during the study period, from which we identified 332,090 cardiovascular disease admissions and 159,365 respiratory disease admissions. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of a cardiorespiratory hospital admission. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (lag0-2 days) was associated with an increase in hospital admissions of 1.23% (95% CI 1.01-1.45%) and 1.95% (95% CI 1.63-2.27%) for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. The elderly were at higher PM-induced risk. The associations appeared to be more evident in the cold season than in the warm season. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes evidence of short-term effects of PM2.5 on cardiorespiratory hospital admissions, which may be helpful for air pollution control and disease prevention in Wuhan.",

      "title": "Short-term associations between particle oxidative potential and daily mortality and hospital admissions in London.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Particulate matter (PM) from traffic and other sources has been associated with adverse health effects. One unifying theory is that PM, whatever its source, acts on the human body via its capacity to cause damaging oxidation reactions related to its content of pro-oxidants components. Few epidemiological studies have investigated particle oxidative potential (OP) and health. We conducted a time series analysis to assess associations between daily particle OP measures and numbers of deaths and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. METHODS: During 2011 and 2012 particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10μm (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) were collected daily on Partisol filters located at an urban background monitoring station in Central London. Particulate OP was assessed based on the capacity of the particles to oxidize ascorbate (OP(AA)) and glutathione (OP(GSH)) from a simple chemical model reflecting the antioxidant composition of human respiratory tract lining fluid. Particulate OP, expressed as % loss of antioxidant per μg of PM, was then multiplied by the daily concentrations of PM to derive the daily OP of PM mass concentrations (% loss per m(3)). Daily numbers of deaths and age- and cause-specific hospital admissions in London were obtained from national registries. Poisson regression accounting for seasonality and meteorology was used to estimate the percentage change in risk of death or admission associated with an interquartile increment in particle OP. RESULTS: We found little evidence for adverse associations between OP(AA) and OP(GSH) and mortality. Associations with cardiovascular admissions were generally positive in younger adults and negative in older adults with confidence intervals including 0%. For respiratory admissions there was a trend, from positive to negative associations, with increasing age although confidence intervals generally included 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, the first to analyse daily particle OP measures and mortality and admissions in a large population over two years, found little evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term exposure to particle OP is associated with adverse health effects. Further studies with improved exposure assessment and longer time series are required to confirm or reject the role of particle OP in triggering exacerbations of disease.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies utilizing source apportionment (SA) of fine particulate matter have shown that particles from certain sources might be more detrimental to health than others; however, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given SA approach. In the present study, we examined associations between source contributions of fine particulate matter and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma in Atlanta, Georgia (2002-2010) using a novel ensemble-based SA technique. Six daily source contributions from 4 SA approaches were combined into an ensemble source contribution. To better account for exposure uncertainty, 10 source profiles were sampled from their posterior distributions, resulting in 10 time series with daily SA concentrations. For each of these time series, Poisson generalized linear models with varying lag structures were used to estimate the health associations for the 6 sources. The rate ratios for the source-specific health associations from the 10 imputed source contribution time series were combined, resulting in health associations with inflated confidence intervals to better account for exposure uncertainty. Adverse associations with pediatric asthma were observed for 8-day exposure to particles generated from diesel-fueled vehicles (rate ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.10) and gasoline-fueled vehicles (rate ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.17).",

This study investigated the potential impacts of ambient particulate matter (PM) on respiratory disease hospitalization in Kandy, Sri Lanka for the year 2019. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was applied to estimate the short-term effect of ambient PM on respiratory disease hospitalization. As the second analysis, respiratory disease hospitalizations during two distinct air pollution periods were analyzed. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in same-day exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease hospitalization by 1.95% (0.25, 3.67) and 1.63% (0.16, 3.12), respectively. The effect of PM2.5 or PM10 on asthma hospitalizations were 4.67% (1.23, 8.23) and 4.04% (1.06, 7.11), respectively (p < 0.05). The 65+ years age group had a higher risk associated with PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases on the same day (2.74% and 2.28%, respectively). Compared to the lower ambient air pollution period, higher increased hospital admissions were observed among those aged above 65 years, males, and COPD and pneumonia hospital admissions during the high ambient air pollution period. Active efforts are crucial to improve ambient air quality in this region to reduce the health effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Australia has experienced extreme fire weather in recent years. Information on the impact of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) from landscape fires (LFs) on cardiorespiratory hospital admissions is limited. METHODS: We conducted a population-based time series study to assess associations between modelled daily elevated PM 2.5 at a 1.5×1.5 km resolution using a modified empirical PM 2.5 exposure model during LFs and hospital admissions for all-cause and cause-specific respiratory and cardiovascular diseases for the study period (2015-2017) in Perth, Western Australia. Multivariate Poisson regressions were used to estimate cumulative risk ratios (RR) with lag effects of 0-3 days, adjusted for sociodemographic factors, weather and time. RESULTS: All-cause hospital admissions and overall cardiovascular admissions increased significantly across each elevated PM 2.5 concentration on most lag days, with the strongest associations of 3% and 7%, respectively, at the high level of ≥12.60 µg/m3 on lag 1 day. For asthma hospitalisation, there was an excess relative risk of up to 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35) with same-day exposure for all people, up to 93% on a lag of 1 day in children and up to 52% on a lag of 3 days in low sociodemographic groups. We also observed an increase of up to 12% (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.24) for arrhythmias on the same exposure day and with over 154% extra risks for angina and 12% for heart failure in disadvantaged groups. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to elevated PM 2.5 concentrations during LFs was associated with increased risks of all-cause hospital admissions, total cardiovascular conditions, asthma and arrhythmias.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide essential information of environmental triggers leading to CRD. METHODS: We investigated the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants on CRD-related hospitalizations in people aged ≥ 65 years in Ningbo. Data on 23,610 cases of CRD requiring hospitalization were collected from January 2015 to August 2017. After adjusting for temporal trends, seasonality, meteorological conditions, day of week (DOW), and public holidays, we used generalized additive Poisson distribution models to calculate the excess risks (ERs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CRD related hospitalizations. RESULTS: Our results showed that fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with CRD-related hospitalizations in people aged ≥ 65 years. We observed that each 10 μg/m3 increase (except for each 0.1 mg/m3 increase in CO) in the concentration of air pollutants, the percentage of CRD-related hospitalizations due to PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 exposure at lag 07, NO2 exposure at lag 03, and CO exposure at lag 0 increased by 2.13% (95% CI: 0.55%, 3.74%), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.70%, 2.83%), 8.24% (95% CI: 0.92%, 16.09%), 2.16% (95% CI: 0.26%, 4.05%), and 1.19% (95% CI: 0.26%, 2.12%), respectively. In addition, we found stronger effects of particulate matter in 75-84 years age group, on warmer days, and in asthmatics. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, air pollution may have adverse effects on CRD-related hospitalizations among people aged ≥ 65 years in Ningbo. Therefore, public health measures should be taken to improve air quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Western Montana, USA, experiences complex air pollution patterns with predominant exposure sources from summer wildfire smoke and winter wood smoke. In addition, climate change related temperatures events are becoming more extreme and expected to contribute to increases in hospital admissions for a range of health outcomes. Evaluating while accounting for these exposures (air pollution and temperature) that often occur simultaneously and may act synergistically on health is becoming more important. METHODS: We explored short-term exposure to air pollution on children's respiratory health outcomes and how extreme temperature or seasonal period modify the risk of air pollution-associated healthcare events. The main outcome measure included individual-based address located respiratory-related healthcare visits for three categories: asthma, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) across western Montana for ages 0-17 from 2017-2020. We used a time-stratified, case-crossover analysis with distributed lag models to identify sensitive exposure windows of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) lagged from 0 (same-day) to 14 prior-days modified by temperature or season. RESULTS: For asthma, increases of 1 µg/m3 in PM2.5 exposure 7-13 days prior a healthcare visit date was associated with increased odds that were magnified during median to colder temperatures and winter periods. For LRTIs, 1 µg/m3 increases during 12 days of cumulative PM2.5 with peak exposure periods between 6-12 days before healthcare visit date was associated with elevated LRTI events, also heightened in median to colder temperatures but no seasonal effect was observed. For URTIs, 1 unit increases during 13 days of cumulative PM2.5 with peak exposure periods between 4-10 days prior event date was associated with greater risk for URTIs visits that were intensified during median to hotter temperatures and spring to summer periods. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed, short-term exposure increases of PM2.5 were associated with elevated odds of all three pediatric respiratory healthcare visit categories in a sparsely population area of the inter-Rocky Mountains, USA. PM2.5 in colder temperatures tended to increase instances of asthma and LRTIs, while PM2.5 during hotter periods increased URTIs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to air pollution has been demonstrated in previous studies to correlate with respiratory disease (RD) in children. Due to regional heterogeneity, our objective was to explore the correlation between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and hospital admissions for respiratory ailments in children in Suzhou City from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022, alongside assessing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on this relationship. METHODS: We collected data on air pollutant levels and hospital admissions for childhood respiratory disease (RD) in Suzhou, China, from 2017 to 2022. We utilized a time-stratified case-crossover design along with a conditional logistic regression model to assess the short-term impacts of air pollutants on RD in children through stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 13,408 children with respiratory diseases were included in the study. The findings revealed significant associations between hospitalization for respiratory diseases in children and exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO. The maximum effect values (95%CI, best lag days) for each 10 µg/m3 increase in the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were as follows: 1.017 (1.003-1.031, lag0-2), 1.015 (1.004-1.026, lag0-2), 1.117 (1.001-1.247, lag0-1), and 1.036 (1.009-1.064, lag0-7). Additionally, the maximum effect value (95%CI, best lag days) for each 1 mg/m3 increase in CO concentration was found to be 1.267 1.017-1.579, lag0-7). Stratified analysis indicated that sex, season of admission, and stage of admission did not modify these correlations significantly; however, differential effects on various age groups and sexes were primarily observed among school-age and older children as well as boys. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO in Suzhou, China, exhibited a positive correlation with RD hospitalization. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse impacts of air pollutants on hospitalizations for childhood respiratory disease were mitigated compared to the period following the pandemic. Local governments should continue promoting decisions and measures for air pollution prevention and control to reduce further pollutant concentration, which is crucial for public health in reducing the burden of childhood respiratory diseases.",

Outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient visits for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma (28,540/24,444 [warm/cold season]), as well as viral infection counts were obtained from electronic health records of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2011 to 2016.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on association between air pollutants and hospital admissions, hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and comorbid respiratory diseases (RD), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with low levels of air pollution. METHODS: Daily data on RD-DM patients were collected in Panzhihua from 2016 to 2020. A generalised additive model (GAM) was used to explore the effect of air pollutants on daily hospital admissions, LOS and hospital cost. Attributable risk was employed to estimate RD-DM's burden due to exceeding air pollution exposure, using both 0 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3) and WHO's 2021 air quality guidelines as reference. RESULTS: For each 10 ug/m3 increase of particles with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 micron (μm) (PM2.5), particles with an aerodynamic diameter <10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), the admissions of RD-DM patients increased by 7.25% (95% CI = 4.26 to 10.33), 5.59% (95% CI = 3.79 to 7.42), 10.10% (95% CI = 7.29 to 12.98), 12.33% (95% CI = 8.82 to 15.95) and -2.99% (95% CI = -4.08 to -1.90); per 1 milligramme per cubic metre (mg/m3) increase of carbon monoxide (CO) corresponded to a 25.77% (95% CI = 17.88 to 34.19) increment for admissions of RD-DM patients. For LOS and hospital cost, the six air pollutants showed similar effect. Given 0 μg/m3 as the reference, NO2 showed the maximum attributable fraction of 32.68% (95% CI = 25.12 to 39.42%), corresponding to an avoidable burden of 5661 (95% CI = 3611 to 5860) patients with RD-DM. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO with increased hospital admissions, LOS and hospital cost in patients with RD-DM. Disease burden of RD-DM may be improved by formulating policies related to air pollutants exposure reduction, especially in LMICs with low levels of air pollution.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) are prevalent in the general population. However, studies on the association of short-term exposure to air pollution with the risk of hospital visits for AURTIs in adults are limited. This study aimed to explore the short-term exposure to air pollutants among Chinese adults living in Ningbo. METHODS: Quasi-Poisson time serious regressions with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were applied to explore the association between ambient air pollution and AURTIs cases. Patients ≥ 18 years who visit three hospitals, being representative for urban, urban-rural junction and rural were included in this retrospective study. RESULTS: In total, 104,441 cases with AURTIs were enrolled in hospital during 2015-2019. The main results showed that particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen dioxide (SO2), were positively associated to hospital visits for AURTIs, except for nitrogen dioxide (O3), which was not statistically significant. The largest single-lag effect for PM2.5 at lag 8 days (RR = 1.02, 95%CI: 1.08-1.40), for NO2 at lag 13 days (RR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00-1.06) and for SO2 at lag 5 days (RR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.08-1.48), respectively. In the stratified analysis, females, and young adults (18-60 years) were more vulnerable to PM2.5 and SO2 and the effect was greater in rural areas and urban-rural junction. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ambient air pollution was significantly associated with hospital visits for AURTIs. This study provides epidemiological evidence for policymakers to control better air quality and establish an enhanced system of air pollution alerts.",

      "title": "Particulate matter and emergency visits for asthma: a time-series study of their association in the presence and absence of wildfire smoke in Reno, Nevada, 2013-2018.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health risks due to particulate matter (PM) from wildfires may differ from risk due to PM from other sources. In places frequently subjected to wildfire smoke, such as Reno, Nevada, it is critical to determine whether wildfire PM poses unique risks. Our goal was to quantify the difference in the association of adverse asthma events with PM on days when wildfire smoke was present versus days when wildfire smoke was not present. METHODS: We obtained counts of visits for asthma at emergency departments and urgent care centers from a large regional healthcare system in Reno for the years 2013-2018. We also obtained dates when wildfire smoke was present from the Washoe County Health District Air Quality Management Division. We then examined whether the presence of wildfire smoke modified the association of PM2.5, PM10-2.5, and PM10 with asthma visits using generalized additive models. We improved on previous studies by excluding wildfire-smoke days where the PM concentration exceeded the maximum PM concentration on other days, thus accounting for possible nonlinearity in the association between PM concentration and asthma visits. RESULTS: Air quality was affected by wildfire smoke on 188 days between 2013 and 2018. We found that the presence of wildfire smoke increased the association of a 5 μg/m3 increase in daily and three-day averages of PM2.5 with asthma visits by 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-10.3%) and 6.8% (CI: 1.2-12.7%), respectively. Similarly, the presence of wildfire smoke increased the association of a 5 μg/m3 increase in daily and three-day averages of PM10 with asthma visits by 5.5% (CI: 2.5-8.6%) and 7.2% (CI: 2.6-12.0%), respectively. We did not observe any significant increases in association for PM10-2.5 or for seven-day averages of PM2.5 and PM10. CONCLUSIONS: Since we found significantly stronger associations of PM2.5 and PM10 with asthma visits when wildfire smoke was present, our results suggest that wildfire PM is more hazardous than non-wildfire PM for patients with asthma.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and poses significant public health risks worldwide. This study evaluated the short-term effects of PM2.5 on hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with additional analyses to identify vulnerable populations based on regional characteristics. The present study analyzed data from 249 Korean communities between 2006 and 2021. Data on daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service. Data on PM2.5 concentrations were sourced from air quality modeling. Additional data on regional characteristics, including the regional deprivation index, proportion of elderly residents, education levels, and greenness levels, were also collected. We used case time series analysis to assess the associations between PM2.5 concentrations and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and explored effect modification by regional characteristics with stratified analyses. The mean numbers of daily cardiovascular admissions and respiratory admissions were 5.68 ± 5.46 and 6.46 ± 8.03, respectively. The mean PM2.5 concentrations were 23.58 ± 13.66 μg/m3. A10 μg/m³ increment in daily PM2.5 concentration was associated with increase of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalization by 0.94% (95% CI: 0.84%, 1.04%) and 1.43% (95% CI: 1.34%, 1.52%), respectively. Regional characteristics analysis showed significant disparities, with higher risks for hospital admissions in areas with lower deprivation and low greenness. This study highlights the significant short-term health impacts of PM2.5 on respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Korean communities. The findings underscore the critical role of regional and demographic factors in modulating these effects, identifying socio-economic areas, age structure of the population, lower education levels, and low greenness as key vulnerability factors.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the short-term association between hospital admissions and individual exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). Particularly, no studies focused on hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at the individual level. We assessed the short-term effects of PM2.5 on hospitalization admissions for COPD in Guangzhou, China, during 2014-2015, based on satellite-derived estimates of ambient PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km resolution near the residential address as individual-level exposure for each patient. Around 40,002 patients with COPD admitted to 110 hospitals were included in this study. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models was applied to assess the effects of PM2.5 based on a 1-km grid data of aerosol optical depth provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on hospital admissions for COPD. Further, we performed stratified analyses by individual demographic characteristics and season of hospital admission. Around 10 μg/m3 increase in individual-level PM2.5 was associated with an increase of 1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6%, 2.7%) in hospitalization for COPD at a lag of 0-5 days. The impact of PM2.5 on hospitalization for COPD was greater significantly in males and patients admitted in summer. Our study strengthened the evidence for the adverse effect of PM2.5 based on satellite-based individual-level exposure data.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Increased air pollutant concentrations have been linked to several asthma-related outcomes in children, including respiratory symptoms, medication use, and hospital visits. However, few studies have examined effects of ultrafine particles in a pediatric population. Our primary objective was to examine the effects of ambient concentrations of ultrafine particles on asthma exacerbation among urban children and determine whether consistent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids could attenuate these effects. We also explored the relationship between asthma exacerbation and ambient concentrations of accumulation mode particles, fine particles (≤2.5 micrograms [μm]; PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. We hypothesized that increased 1-7 day concentrations of ultrafine particles and other pollutants would be associated with increases in the relative odds of an asthma exacerbation, but that this increase in risk would be attenuated among children receiving school-based corticosteroid therapy. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study using data from 3 to 10 year-old children participating in the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial. Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we estimated the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit treated with prednisone (n=96 visits among 74 children) associated with increased pollutant concentrations in the previous 7 days. We re-ran these analyses separately for children receiving medications through the school-based intervention and children in a usual care control group. RESULTS: Interquartile range increases in ultrafine particles and carbon monoxide concentrations in the previous 7 days were associated with increases in the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit, with the largest increases observed for 4-day mean ultrafine particles (interquartile range=2088p/cm(3); OR=1.27; 95% CI=0.90-1.79) and 7-day mean carbon monoxide (interquartile range=0.17ppm; OR=1.63; 95% CI=1.03-2.59). Relative odds estimates were larger among children receiving school-based inhaled corticosteroid treatment. We observed no such associations with accumulation mode particles, black carbon, fine particles (≤2.5μm), or sulfur dioxide. Ozone concentrations were inversely associated with the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a response to markers of traffic pollution among urban asthmatic children. Effects were strongest among children receiving preventive medications through school, suggesting that this group of children was particularly sensitive to environmental triggers. Medication adherence alone may be insufficient to protect the most vulnerable from environmental asthma triggers. However, further research is necessary to confirm this finding.",

      "title": "Multifactorial airborne exposures and respiratory hospital admissions--the example of Santiago de Chile.",
      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Our results provide evidence for respiratory effects of combined exposure to airborne pollutants in Santiago de Chile. Different pollutants account for varying adverse effects. Ozone was not found to be significantly associated with respiratory morbidity. BACKGROUND: High concentrations of various air pollutants have been associated with hospitalization due to development and exacerbation of respiratory diseases. The findings of different studies vary in effect strength and are sometimes inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess associations between airborne exposures by particulate matter as well as gaseous air pollutants and hospital admissions due to respiratory disease groups under the special orographic and meteorological conditions of Santiago de Chile. METHODS: The study was performed in the metropolitan area of Santiago de Chile during 2004-2007. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover analysis taking temporal variation, meteorological conditions and autocorrelation into account. We computed associations between daily ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5 - particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 or 2.5 μm, respectively) or ozone (O3) and hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses. RESULTS: We found for CO, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 adverse relationships to respiratory admissions while effect strength and lag depended on the pollutant and on the disease group. By trend, in 1-pollutant models most adverse pollutants were CO and PM10 followed by PM2.5, while in 2-pollutant models effects of NO2 persisted in most cases whereas other effects weakened and significant effects remain for PM2.5, only. In addition the strongest effects seemed to be immediate or with a delay of up to one day, but effects were found until day 7, too. Adverse effects of ozone could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Taking case numbers and effect strength of all cardiovascular diseases into account, mitigation measures should address all pollutants especially CO, NO2, and PM10.",

      "abstract": "Existing PM2.5-morbidity studies using daily mean concentration as exposure metric may fail to capture intra-day variations of PM2.5 concentrations, resulting in underestimated health impacts to some extent. This study introduced a novel indicator, daily excessive concentration hours (DECH), defined as sums of per-hourly excessive concentrations of PM2.5 against a specific threshold within a day. PM2.5 DECHs were separately calculated as daily concentration-hours >8, 10, 15, 20, and 25 μg/m3 (abbreviations: DECH-8, DECH-10, DECH-15, DECH-20, and DECH-25). We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models to compare risks of hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with PM2.5 mean and DECHs in Shenzhen, China. We observed highly comparable PM2.5-COPD associations using exposure metrics of daily mean and DECHs with above-defined thresholds. For instance, PM2.5 mean and DECHs showed similar increases in risks of COPD hospitalization for an interquartile range rise in exposure, with odds ratio estimates of 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.50) for PM2.5 mean, 1.24 (1.05-1.46) for DECH-10 and 1.21 (1.06-1.39) for DECH-25, respectively. Findings remained robust after further adjusting for gaseous pollutants (e.g., SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) and meteorologic factors (e.g., wind speed and air pressure). Our study strengthened the evidence that DECHs could come be as a novel exposure metric in health risk assessments associated with short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the short-term impacts of ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution on morbidity in China. The aims of this study were to examine the short-term association between hospital admissions and ambient PM and also to explore whether PM2.5 at levels below current regulatory limits also increases the risk of hospitalizations in 26 Chinese cities. METHODS: We identified 14,569,622 all-cause, 2,008,786 cardiovascular, and 916,388 respiratory admissions during 2014-2015. We employed conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between hospital admissions and ambient PM. RESULTS: A 10 μg/m increase in PM2.5 at lag 0 day corresponded to increases of 0.19% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18%, 0.20%) in all-cause, 0.23% (95% CI = 0.20%, 0.26%) in cardiovascular, and 0.26% (95% CI = 0.22%, 0.31%) in respiratory admissions. For PM10, the values were 0.12% (95% CI = 0.11%, 0.13%) for all-cause, 0.15% (95% CI = 0.13%, 0.17%) for cardiovascular, and 0.21% (95% CI = 0.17%, 0.24%) for respiratory admissions. The associations held at PM2.5 levels below the current Chinese and European/WHO standards. Among individuals with exposure levels below 25 μg/m, increasing PM2.5 levels from below 15 μg/m to above 15 μg/m was associated with increases of 1.8% (odds ratio, 1.018; 95% CI = 1.015, 1.022) in all-cause admissions and 2.5% (odds ratio, 1.025; 95% CI = 1.017, 1.034) in cardiovascular admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PM exposures were associated with increased hospitalizations, even for exposure levels not exceeding the current regulatory limits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although air pollution is a serious problem in Ahvaz, the association between air pollution and respiratory diseases has not been studied enough in this area. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between short-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of hospital admissions due to asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis in Ahvaz. METHODS: Hospital admissions data and air pollutants including O3, NO, NO2, SO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 were obtained from 2008 to 2018. Adjusted Quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag model, controlled for trend, seasonality, weather, weekdays, and holidays was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in hospital admissions for asthma (RR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007) and COPD (RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.005) associated with PM2.5. PM10 was associated with increased hospital admissions due to bronchiectasis in both genders (Men: RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006) (Female: RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006). NO2 was also associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for asthma (RR=1.040, 95% CI: 1.008-1.074) and COPD (RR=1.049, 95% CI: 1.010-1.090). SO2 was associated with the risk of hospital admissions of asthma (RR=1.069, 95% CI: 1.017-1.124) and bronchiectasis (RR=1.030, 95% CI: 1.005-1.056). Finally, CO was associated with COPD (RR=1.643, 95% CI: 1.233-2.191) and bronchiectasis (RR=1.542, 95% CI: 1.035-2.298) hospital admissions. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to air pollutants significantly increases the risk of hospital admissions for asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis in the adult and elderly population.",

      "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether there was a correlation between fine particles (PM2.5) levels and hospital admissions for pneumonia in Taipei, Taiwan. Hospital admissions for pneumonia and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period from 2006 to 2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions for pneumonia was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased numbers of admissions for pneumonia were significantly associated with higher PM2.5 levels both on warm days (>23°C) and on cool days (<23°C). This was accompanied by an interquartile range elevation correlated with a 12% (95% CI = 16%-13%) and 4% (95% CI = 3%-6%) rise in number of admissions for pneumonia, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 remained significant after inclusion of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) or ozone (O₃) both on warm and on cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 increase the risk of hospital admissions for pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "Although respiratory disease has been strongly connected to fine particulate air pollution (particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5)), evidence has been mixed regarding the effects of coarse particles (particulate matter from 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter), possibly because of the greater spatial heterogeneity of coarse particles. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between coarse particles and respiratory emergency department visits, including common subdiagnoses, from 2005 to 2008 in 35 California counties. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to help control for time-invariant confounders and seasonal influences, and the study population was limited to those residing within 20 km of pollution monitors to mitigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity. Significant associations between respiratory emergency department visits and coarse particle levels were observed. Asthma visits showed associations (for 2-day lag, excess risk per 10 μg/m³ = 3.3%, 95% confidence interval: 2.0, 4.6) that were robust to adjustment by other common air pollutants (particles <2.5 μm in diameter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide). Pneumonia and acute respiratory infection visits were not associated, although some suggestion of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits was present. Our results indicate that coarse particle exposure may trigger asthma exacerbations requiring emergency care, and reducing exposures among asthmatic persons may provide benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the relationship between air pollution and hospital admissions for asthma in older adults, and to further assess the health and economic burden of asthma admissions attributable to air pollution. METHODS: We collected information on asthma cases in people over 65 years of age from nine cities in Sichuan province, as well as air pollution and meteorological data. The relationship between short-term air pollutant exposure and daily asthma hospitalizations was analyzed using the generalized additive model (GAM), and stratified by gender, age, and season. In addition, we assessed the economic burden of hospitalization for air pollution-related asthma in older adults using the cost of disease approach. RESULTS: The single pollutant model showed that every 1 mg/m3 increase in CO was linked with an increase in daily hospitalizations for older adults with asthma, with relative risk values of 1.327 (95% CI: 1.116-1.577) at lag7. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, on asthma hospitalization, with relative risk values of 1.044 (95% CI: 1.011-1.078), 1.018 (95% CI: 1.002-1.034), 1.013 (95% CI: 1.004-1.022), 1.015 (95% CI: 1.003-1.028) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.041-1.227), respectively. Stratified analysis shows that stronger associations between air pollution and asthma HAs among older adult in females, those aged 65-69 years, and in the warm season, although all of the differences between subgroups did not reach statistical significance. During the study period, the number of asthma hospitalizations attributable to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 pollution was 764, 581 and 95, respectively, which resulted in a total economic cost of 6.222 million CNY, 4.73 million CNY and 0.776 million CNY, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that short-term exposure to air pollutants is positively associated with an increase in numbers of asthma of people over 65 years of age in Sichuan province, and short-term exposure to excessive PM and NO2 brings health and economic burden to individuals and society.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to high Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations worsens several respiratory conditions. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between short-term exposure to Particulate Matter and fine Particulate Matter (PM10 - PM2.5) and Emergency Department (ED) admissions and hospitalizations for COPD exacerbation observed at the University Hospital, Spedali Civili of Brescia, a city with some of the highest yearly levels of air pollution in Italy. METHODS: We collected data from patients admitted to the ED with a COPD exacerbation diagnosis, starting from January 2014 to January 2016. Daily PM levels were collected from the Environmental Protection Regional Agency (ARPA). We performed a time-series analysis using the Poisson regression model with single and multiple day-lag. Results were expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and Excess of Relative Risk (ER) for COPD exacerbation-related ED admissions and hospitalizations, over a 10μg/m3 increase in PM concentration. RESULTS: We collected data from 431 COPD patients. Both PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly associated with the risk of COPD exacerbation-related ED admission and hospitalization. Each increase of 10μg/m3 of PM10 and PM2.5 corresponded respectively to a RR for ED admissions of 1.06 and 1.08 at lag0-1; 1.06 and 1.09 at lag0-5 (p < 0.05). Similar results for COPD Exacerbation-related hospitalizations were found, with a RR of 1.07 and 1.10 at lag0-1 and 1.07 and 1.11 at lag0-5 for each increase of 10μg/m3 PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that in a highly polluted city of Northern Italy, short-term increase in exposure to PM10-PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of ED admission and hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation with a greater incidence during the winter season.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Whereas associations between air pollution and respiratory morbidity for adults 65 years and older are well documented in the United States, the evidence for people under 65 is less extensive. To address this gap, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program collected respiratory emergency department (ED) data from 17 states. OBJECTIVES: To estimate age-specific acute effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (particulate matter ≤2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) on respiratory ED visits. METHODS: We conducted time-series analyses in 894 counties by linking daily respiratory ED visits with estimated ozone and PM2.5 concentrations during the week before the date of the visit. Overall effect estimates were obtained with a Bayesian hierarchical model to combine county estimates for each pollutant by age group (children, 0-18; adults, 19-64; adults ≥ 65, and all ages) and by outcome group (acute respiratory infection, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and all respiratory ED visits). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rate ratios (95% credible interval) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and all respiratory ED visits were 1.024 (1.018-1.029) among children, 1.008 (1.004-1.012) among adults younger than 65 years, and 1.002 (0.996-1.007) among adults 65 and older. Per 20-ppb increase in ozone, rate ratios were 1.017 (1.011-1.023) among children, 1.051 (1.046-1.056) among adults younger than 65, and 1.033 (1.026-1.040) among adults 65 and older. Associations varied in magnitude by age group for each outcome group. CONCLUSIONS: These results address a gap in the evidence used to ensure adequate public health protection under national air pollution policies.",

Using a case-crossover analysis, we observed associations of vehicular emissions with all cardiovascular EDVs (excess risk = 1.6%, 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 2.4 for an interquartile-range increment of 2.8 µg/m(3)) and with several subclasses of disease. In addition, vehicular emissions, biomass burning, and soil sources were associated with all respiratory EDVs and with EDVs for asthma. The soil source, which includes resuspended road dust, generated the highest risk estimate for asthma (excess risk = 4.5%, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 8.0). Overall, our results provide additional evidence of the public health consequences of exposure to specific sources of PM2.5 and indicate that some sources of PM2.5 may pose higher risks than the overall PM2.5 mass.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found associations between asthma morbidity and air pollution especially in young population, (PLoS One 12:e0180522, 2017; Can J Public Health 103:4-8, 2012; Environ Health Perspect 118:449-57, 2010; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 182:307-16, 2010; J Allergy Clin Immunol 104:717-22, 2008; J Allergy Clin Immunol 104:717-22, 1999; Environ Res 111:1137-47, 2011) but most of them were conducted in areas with relatively low air pollutant level. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the effect and burden modification of heating season during which the ambient air pollution level is significantly different from that during non-heating season in north China. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect and burden modification of heating on short-term associations between adult asthma hospitalizations and ambient air pollution in the north China city of Shijiazhuang. METHODS: Generalized additive models combined with penalized distributed lag nonlinear models were used to model associations between daily asthma hospitalizations and ambient air pollutants from 1 January 2013 to 16 December 2016 in Shijiazhuang city, adjusting for long-term and seasonality trend, day of week, statutory holiday, daily mean air pressure and temperature. Attributable risks were calculated to evaluate the burden of asthma hospitalizations due to air pollutants exposure. The effect of pollutants on hospitalization and the attributable measures were estimated in heating and non-heating season separately and the comparisons between the two seasons were conducted. RESULTS: All pollutants demonstrated positive and significant impacts on asthma hospitalizations both in heating season and non-heating season, except for O3 in heating season where a negative association was observed. However, the differences of the pollutant-specific effects between the two seasons were not significant. SO2 and NO2 exposure were associated with the heaviest burden among all pollutants in heating season; meanwhile, PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with the heaviest burden in heating season. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found evidence of the effect of ambient air pollutants on asthma hospitalizations in Shijiazhuang. The central heating period could modify the effects in terms of attributable risks. The disease burden modification of heating should be taken into consideration when planning intervention measures to reduce the risk of asthma hospitalization.",

      "title": "Children's exposure to air pollution in a natural gas industrial area and their risk of hospital admission for respiratory diseases.",
      "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the natural gas industry to meet the global demand have raised environmental health concerns. Few studies have found that areas with natural gas industrial activity have poor air quality. However, the negative health impacts of ambient air pollution in a natural gas industrial area remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollution and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children in a natural gas industrial area in Bintulu, Malaysia. Daily hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children were collected from a hospital in Bintulu from 2010 to 2019. Data on six air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) in the study area were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia. Quasi-Poisson time series regressions with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were applied to explore the associations between ambient air pollution and childhood hospitalisations for respiratory diseases. Stratification analyses were performed by gender and age group to identify the vulnerable populations. A 10 μg/m3 increased PM2.5 and SO2 was associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children with the greatest relative risk of RR 1.089 (95% CI 1.001-1.183) at cumulative lag 0-2 days and RR 1.229 (95% CI 1.073-1.409) at cumulative lag 0-6 days, respectively. There was no significant association between short-term exposure of PM10, NO2, CO, and O3 with childhood respiratory hospitalisation. The association between PM2.5 and SO2 exposure and hospital admissions for childhood respiratory diseases in the two pollutants model remained statistically significant. There were stronger associations in younger children aged 0-4 years and girls. This study reveals that short-term exposure to SO2 was associated with a higher risk of respiratory hospitalisations among children in Bintulu than PM2.5. Better air quality control is necessary for children's health living in the natural gas industrial area.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on children with acute bronchitis. This study aimed to explore the acute effects of four air pollutants [fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] on the daily number of children admitted to the hospital for acute bronchitis in Sichuan Province, China. METHODS: The 49,975 records of hospitalized children with acute bronchitis from medical institutions in nine cities/prefectures, Sichuan Province, China, as well as the simultaneous meteorological data and air pollution data from 183 monitoring sites, were collected from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. A generalized additive model was adopted to analyze the exposure-response and lag effects of hospitalizations of children with acute bronchitis to air pollutants. Stratified analyses were conducted based on sex, age, and season. RESULTS: The single-pollutant model showed that a 10 µg/m3 increase at lag07 of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 corresponded to an increase of 1.23% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-2.26%], 1.33% (95% CI 0.62-2.05%), 23.52% (95% CI 11.52-36.81%), and 12.47% (95% CI 8.46-16.64%) in daily hospitalizations for children with acute bronchitis, respectively. Children aged 0-2 were more prone to PM2.5 (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the effects were stronger in the warm season than in transition seasons and the cool season for PM2.5 and PM10 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The higher daily average concentrations of four pollutants in Sichuan Province can result in an increased number of children hospitalized for acute bronchitis.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have found strong associations between asthma morbidity and major ambient air pollutants. Relatively little research has been conducted to assess whether age is a factor conferring susceptibility to air pollution-related asthma morbidity. We investigated the short-term relationships between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and ambient ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Atlanta (1993-2009), Dallas (2006-2009), and St. Louis (2001-2007). City-specific daily time-series analyses were conducted to estimate associations by age group (0-4, 5-18, 19-39, 40-64, and 65+ years). Sub-analyses were performed stratified by race and sex. City-specific rate ratios (RRs) were combined by inverse-variance weighting to provide an overall association for each strata. The overall RRs differed across age groups, with associations for all pollutants consistently strongest for children aged 5-18 years. The patterns of association across age groups remained generally consistent when models were stratified by sex and race, although the strong observed associations among 5-18 year olds appeared to be partially driven by non-white and male patients. Our findings suggest that age is a susceptibility factor for asthma exacerbations in response to air pollution, with school-age children having the highest susceptibility.",

Daily concentrations of the pollutant fine particulate matter were estimated using the CAMS mathematical model, made available by CPTEC. Diagnoses of tracheitis and laryngitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma were included. INMET provided data on maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity. Statistical analysis was performed with three generalized additive Poisson regression models, one of which only included the minimum temperature, another including the pollutant and the last with an interaction variable. There were 1,612 hospitalizations in the period; in the multivariate model, associations were identified between minimum temperature and hospitalizations in lags 1 to 5; the effect of increasing the minimum temperature by 4°C resulted in an increase in the risk of hospitalizations by 18%; 15.2% of hospitalizations are attributed to this increase and an excess of approximately US$ 68,000.00 in expenses for the health system during the period evaluated. In addition to the known effects of exposure to pollutants on health, it was possible to identify that an increase in the minimum daily temperature can cause damage to children's health.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) visit and hospital admissions (HA) data have been an indispensible resource for assessing acute morbidity impacts of air pollution. ED visits and HAs are types of health care visits with similarities, but also potentially important differences. Little previous information is available regarding the impact of health care visit type on observed acute air pollution-health associations from studies conducted for the same location, time period, outcome definitions and model specifications. METHODS: As part of a broader study of air pollution and health in St. Louis, individual-level ED and HA data were obtained for a 6.5 year period for acute care hospitals in the eight Missouri counties of the St. Louis metropolitan area. Patient demographic characteristics and diagnostic code distributions were compared for four visit types including ED visits, HAs, HAs that came through the ED, and non-elective HAs. Time-series analyses of the relationship between daily ambient ozone and PM₂.₅ and selected cardiorespiratory outcomes were conducted for each visit type. RESULTS: Our results indicate that, compared with ED patients, HA patients tended to be older, had evidence of greater severity for some outcomes, and had a different mix of specific outcomes. Consideration of 'HA through ED' appeared to more effectively select acute visits than consideration of 'non-elective HA'. While outcomes with the strongest observed temporal associations with air pollutants tended to show strong associations for all visit types, we found some differences in observed associations for ED visits and HAs. For example, risk ratios for the respiratory disease-ozone association were 1.020 for ED visits and 1.004 for 'HA through ED'; risk ratios for the asthma/wheeze-ozone association were 1.069 for ED visits and 1.106 for 'HA through ED'. Several factors (e.g. age) were identified that may be responsible, in part, for the differences in observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and diagnostic differences between visit types may lead to preference for one visit type over another for some questions and populations. The strengths of observed associations with air pollutants sometimes varied between different health care visit types, but the relative strengths of association generally were specific to the pollutant-outcome combination.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess relative and absolute risks of hospital admissions and emergency department visits for natural causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease associated with daily exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at concentrations below the new World Health Organization air quality guideline limit among adults with health insurance in the contiguous US. DESIGN: Case time series study. SETTING: US national administrative healthcare claims database. PARTICIPANTS: 50.1 million commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries aged ≥18 years between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily counts of hospital admissions and emergency department visits for natural causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease based on the primary diagnosis code. RESULTS: During the study period, 10.3 million hospital admissions and 24.1 million emergency department visits occurred for natural causes among 50.1 million adult enrollees across 2939 US counties. The daily PM2.5 levels were below the new WHO guideline limit of 15 μg/m3 for 92.6% of county days (7 360 725 out of 7 949 713). On days when daily PM2.5 levels were below the new WHO air quality guideline limit of 15 μg/m3, an increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 during the current and previous day was associated with higher risk of hospital admissions for natural causes, with an excess relative risk of 0.91% (95% confidence interval 0.55% to 1.26%), or 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 2.59) excess hospital admissions per million enrollees per day. The increased risk of hospital admissions for natural causes was observed exclusively among adults aged ≥65 years and was not evident in younger adults. PM2.5 levels were also statistically significantly associated with relative risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. For emergency department visits, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 during the current and previous day was associated with respiratory disease, with an excess relative risk of 1.34% (0.73% to 1.94%), or 0.93 (0.52 to 1.35) excess emergency department visits per million enrollees per day. This association was not found for natural causes or cardiovascular disease. The higher risk of emergency department visits for respiratory disease was strongest among middle aged and young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Among US adults with health insurance, exposure to ambient PM2.5 at concentrations below the new WHO air quality guideline limit is statistically significantly associated with higher rates of hospital admissions for natural causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, and with emergency department visits for respiratory diseases. These findings constitute an important contribution to the debate about the revision of air quality limits, guidelines, and standards.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Airborne pollutants may worsen the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previous studies have shown that both particulate and gaseous pollutants increase airway inflammation, which may lead to an exacerbation of COPD. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between exposure to airborne pollutants and the risk of COPD exacerbations in 3 the largest urban agglomerations in Poland: Warsaw, Kraków, and Tricity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a case‑crossover approach to analyze data from the years 2011-2018. This time‑series study used distributed lag linear-nonlinear models to analyze the risk of hospital admission due to COPD exacerbations during 21 days following the exposure to particulate matter (PM), NO2, and SO2. RESULTS: Overall, there were 26 948 admissions due to COPD exacerbations. During 21 days after exposure, the rate ratio (95% CI) for admissions per 10 μg/m3 was 1.028 (1.008-1.049) for PM10, 1.030 (1.006-1.055) for PM2.5, 1.032 (0.988-1.078) for NO2, and 1.145 (1.038-1.262) for SO2. The risk for admission peaked at 10 days after the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, whereas for NO2 and SO2 the risk was the greatest on the day of exposure. The proportion (95% CI) of hospitalizations attributable to air pollution was 9.08% (3.10%-15.08%) for PM10, 7.61% (1.27%-13.49%) for PM2.5, 9.77% (-3.63% to 21.48%) for NO2, and 7.70% (2.30%-12.84%) for SO2. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 pollution was associated with an increased risk of COPD exacerbations that needed hospitalization. There were different risk patterns for particulate and gaseous pollutants. Improving air quality in Polish cities could reduce the burden of COPD.",

      "title": "Distributed lag analyses of daily hospital admissions and source-apportioned fine particle air pollution.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Past time-series studies of the health effects of fine particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5)] have used chemically nonspecific PM2.5 mass. However, PM2.5 is known to vary in chemical composition with source, and health impacts may vary accordingly. OBJECTIVE: We tested the association between source-specific daily PM2.5 mass and hospital admissions in a time-series investigation that considered both single-lag and distributed-lag models. METHODS: Daily PM2.5 speciation measurements collected in midtown Manhattan were analyzed via positive matrix factorization source apportionment. Daily and distributed-lag generalized linear models of Medicare respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions during 2001-2002 considered PM2.5 mass and PM2.5 from five sources: transported sulfate, residual oil, traffic, steel metal works, and soil. RESULTS: Source-related PM2.5 (specifically steel and traffic) was significantly associated with hospital admissions but not with total PM2.5 mass. Steel metal works-related PM2.5 was associated with respiratory admissions for multiple-lag days, especially during the cleanup efforts at the World Trade Center. Traffic-related PM2.5 was consistently associated with same-day cardiovascular admissions across disease-specific subcategories. PM2.5 constituents associated with each source (e.g., elemental carbon with traffic) were likewise associated with admissions in a consistent manner. Mean effects of distributed-lag models were significantly greater than were maximum single-day effect models for both steel- and traffic-related PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Past analyses that have considered only PM2.5 mass or only maximum single-day lag effects have likely underestimated PM2.5 health effects by not considering source-specific and distributed-lag effects. Differing lag structures and disease specificity observed for steel-related versus traffic-related PM2.5 raise the possibility of distinct mechanistic pathways of health effects for particles of differing chemical composition.",

      "title": "Associations of short-term exposure to air pollution and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma in Shanghai, China.",
      "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the relationship between air pollution and pediatric asthma in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits in Shanghai, China. We collected data on six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) and daily ED visits for pediatric asthma patients from 66 hospitals in Shanghai from 2016 to 2018. The generalized additive model combined with polynomial distributed lag model was applied to explore the associations. We fitted two-pollutant models and stratified the analyses by sex, age, and season. In total, we identified 108,817 emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 was significantly associated with increased risks of pediatric asthma ED visits, with relative risk of pediatric asthma of 1.011 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.002, 1.021], 1.030 (95%CI: 1.017, 1.043), 1.106 (95%CI: 1.041, 1.174), and 1.009 (95%CI: 1.001, 1.017), respectively. The associations of NO2 remained robust in the two-pollutant models. There were stronger associations for older children (6-18 years) and in warm seasons. The concentration-response curves for pediatric asthma and PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 were steeper at lower and moderate concentrations but became flatter at higher concentrations. This analysis provided evidence that short-term exposure to air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3) could increase the risk of asthma exacerbations among children, and health benefits would be gained from improved air quality.",

      "abstract": "Ambient air pollution in urban areas may trigger asthma exacerbations. We carried out a time-series analysis of the association between the concentrations of various air pollutants and the risk of hospital admission due to asthma over 7 days from exposure. We used distributed lag nonlinear models to analyze data gathered between 2010 and 2018 in the three largest urban agglomerations in Poland. Overall, there were 31,919 asthma hospitalizations. Over 7 days since exposure, the rate ratio (95%CI) for admission per 10 µg/m3 was 1.013 (1.002-1.024) for PM10; 1.014 (1.000-1.028) for PM2.5; 1.054 (1.031-1.078) for NO2; and 1.044 for SO2 (95%CI: 0.986-1.104). For all pollutants, the risk of admission was the greatest on the day of exposure (day 0), decreased below baseline on days 1 and 2, and then increased gradually up to day 6. The proportions (95%CI) of hospitalizations attributable to air pollution were 4.52% (0.80%-8.14%) for PM10; 3.74% (0.29%-7.11%) for PM2.5; 16.4% (10.0%-21.8%) for NO2; and 2.50% (-0.75%-5.36%) for SO2. In conclusion, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 pollution was associated with an increased risk of hospital admission due to asthma in the three largest urban agglomerations in Poland over nine years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to air pollution is associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children. We investigated the relationship between hospitalization for ALRI in children and air pollutant concentrations from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020 in Lanzhou City. METHODS: We collected data on air pollutant concentrations and children's hospitalization data during the study period. A time series regression analysis was used to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants on ALRI in children, and subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 51,206 children with ALRI were studied, including 40,126 cases of pneumonia and 11,080 cases of bronchiolitis. The results of the study revealed that PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were significantly associated with hospitalization for ALRI in children aged 0-14 years. For each 10 µg/m3 increase in air pollutant concentration in lag0-7, the relative risk of ALRI hospitalization in children due to PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increased by 1.089 (95%CI:1.075, 1.103), 1.018 (95%CI:1.014, 1.021), 1.186 (95%CI:1.154. 1.219) and 1.149 (95%CI:1.130, 1.168), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 short-term exposures were positively associated with ALRI, pneumonia and bronchiolitis hospitalizations in Lanzhou, China. Local governments should make efforts to improve urban ambient air quality conditions to reduce hospitalization rates for childhood respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of exposure to fine particulate matter ([Formula: see text]) during wildland fires are not well understood in comparison with [Formula: see text] exposures from other sources. OBJECTIVES: We examined the cardiopulmonary effects of short-term exposure to [Formula: see text] on smoke days in the United States to evaluate whether health effects are consistent with those during non-smoke days. METHODS: We examined cardiopulmonary hospitalizations among adults [Formula: see text] y of age, in U.S. counties ([Formula: see text]) within [Formula: see text] of 123 large wildfires during 2008-2010. We evaluated associations during smoke and non-smoke days and examined variability with respect to modeled and observed exposure metrics. Poisson regression was used to estimate county-specific effects at lag days 0-6 (L0-6), adjusted for day of week, temperature, humidity, and seasonal trend. We used meta-analyses to combine county-specific effects and estimate overall percentage differences in hospitalizations expressed per [Formula: see text] increase in [Formula: see text]. RESULTS: Exposure to [Formula: see text], on all days and locations, was associated with increased hospitalizations on smoke and non-smoke days using modeled exposure metrics. The estimated effects persisted across multiple lags, with a percentage increase of 1.08% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28, 1.89] on smoke days and 0.67% (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 1.44) on non-smoke days for respiratory and 0.61% (95% CI: 0.09, 1.14) on smoke days and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.2) on non-smoke days for cardiovascular outcomes on L1. For asthma-related hospitalizations, the percentage increase was greater on smoke days [6.9% (95% CI: 3.71, 10.11)] than non-smoke days [1.34% (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 3.77)] on L1. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of [Formula: see text]-related cardiopulmonary hospitalizations was similar on smoke and non-smoke days across multiple lags and exposure metrics, whereas risk for asthma-related hospitalizations was higher during smoke days. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3860.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution can cause respiratory symptoms or exacerbate pre-existing respiratory diseases, especially in children. This study looked at the short-term association of air pollution concentrations with Emergency Room (ER) admissions for respiratory reasons in pediatric age (0-18 years). METHODS: Daily number of ER admissions in a children's Hospital, concentrations of urban-background PM2.5, NO2, O3 and total aeroallergens (Corylaceae, Cupressaceae, Gramineae, Urticaceae, Ambrosia, Betula) were collected in Turin, northwestern Italy, for the period 1/08/2008 to 31/12/2010 (883 days). The associations between exposures and ER admissions were estimated, at time lags between 0 and 5 days, using generalized linear Poisson regression models, adjusted for non-meteorological potential confounders. RESULTS: In the study period, 21,793 ER admissions were observed, mainly (81 %) for upper respiratory tract infections. Median air pollution concentrations were 22.0, 42.5, 34.1 μg/m(3) for urban-background PM2.5, NO2, and O3, respectively, and 2.9 grains/m(3) for aeroallergens. We found that ER admissions increased by 1.3 % (95 % CI: 0.3-2.2 %) five days after a 10 μg/m(3) increase in NO2, and by 0.7 % (95 % CI: 0.1-1.2 %) one day after a 10 grains/m(3) increase in aeroallergens, while they were not associated with PM2.5 concentrations. ER admissions were negatively associated with O3 and aeroallergen concentrations at some time lags, but these association shifted to the null when meteorological confounders were adjusted for in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings confirm adverse short-term health effects of air pollution on the risk of ER admission in children and encourage a careful management of the urban environment to health protection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2014, the Hazelwood coalmine fire in regional Victoria, Australia shrouded nearby communities in smoke for six weeks. Prior investigations identified substantial adverse effects, including increases in the use of health services. In this study, we examined the effects on hospital and ambulance use in the eight years following the fire. METHODS: Using Victorian hospital (Jan 2009-Jun 2022) and ambulance (Jan 2013-Dec 2021) data, we conducted an interrupted time series of changes to the rate of hospital admissions, emergency presentations, and ambulance attendances. A categorical exposure model compared two locations, most-exposed Morwell and less-exposed Latrobe Valley, to the rest of regional Victoria. A continuous exposure model used spatial estimates of fire-related PM2.5. Analyses were stratified by sex, age group (<65/65+ years), and condition (cardiovascular, respiratory, mental health, injury). RESULTS: There were small but significant increases in overall hospital admissions and emergency presentations across all analyses, but little evidence of change in overall ambulance attendances. Effects varied considerably by condition, with the biggest relative increases observed among hospital admissions for mental health conditions and injuries. While cardiovascular-related hospital admissions and emergency presentations increased post-fire, ambulance attendances decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the Hazelwood coalmine fire likely increased hospital usage. However, it is unclear whether this was due to the direct effects of smoke exposure on health, or the disruptive socioeconomic and behavioural impacts of an environmental disaster that affected how communities engaged with various health services.",

      "abstract": "Upper and lower respiratory infections are common in early childhood and may be exacerbated by air pollution. We investigated short-term changes in ambient air pollutant concentrations, including speciated particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), in relation to emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory infections in young children. Daily counts of ED visits for bronchitis and bronchiolitis (n = 80,399), pneumonia (n = 63,359), and upper respiratory infection (URI) (n = 359,246) among children 0-4 years of age were collected from hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia, area for the period 1993-2010. Daily pollutant measurements were combined across monitoring stations using population weighting. In Poisson generalized linear models, 3-day moving average concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and the organic carbon fraction of particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) were associated with ED visits for pneumonia and URI. Ozone associations were strongest and were observed at low (cold-season) concentrations; a 1-interquartile range increase predicted a 4% increase (95% confidence interval: 2%, 6%) in visits for URI and an 8% increase (95% confidence interval: 4%, 13%) in visits for pneumonia. Rate ratios tended to be higher in the 1- to 4-year age group compared with infants. Results suggest that primary traffic pollutants, ozone, and the organic carbon fraction of PM2.5 exacerbate upper and lower respiratory infections in early life, and that the carbon fraction of PM2.5 is a particularly harmful component of the ambient particulate matter mixture.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported a link between short-term exposure to environmental stressors (air pollution and air temperature) and atherothrombotic cardiovascular diseases. However, only few of them reported consistent associations with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Our aim was to estimate the association between daily air temperature and particulate matter (PM) air pollution with hospital admissions for pulmonary embolism (PE) and venous thrombosis (VT) at national level in Italy. METHODS: We collected daily hospital PE and VT admissions from the Italian Ministry of Health during 2006-2015 in all the 8,084 municipalities of Italy, and we merged them with air temperature and daily PM10 concentrations estimated by satellite-based spatiotemporal models. First, we applied multivariate Poisson regression models at province level. Then, we obtained national overall effects by random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: This analysis was conducted on 219,952 PE and 275,506 VT hospitalizations. Meta-analytical results showed weak associations between the two exposures and the study outcomes in the full year analysis. During autumn and winter, PE hospital admissions increased by 1.07% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.21%; 1.92%) and 0.96% (95% CI: 0.07%; 1.83%) respectively, per 1 °C decrement of air temperature in the previous 10 days (lag 0-10). In summer we observed adverse effects at high temperatures, with a 1% (95% CI: 0.10%; 1.91%) increasing risk per 1 °C increment. We found no association between VT and cold temperatures. CONCLUSION: Results show a significant effect of air temperature on PE hospitalizations in the cold seasons and summer. No effect of particulate matter was detected.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution can cause various respiratory and neurological diseases and continuous exposure can lead to death. Previous studies have reported that particulate matter (PM) exposure increases the risk of depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal death; however, the results are inconsistent and limited. This study aimed to examine the relationship between short-term PM exposure and suicide deaths, as well as investigate the short-term effects of PM on suicide death within vulnerable groups based on factors such as sex, age group, suicide-related information (note, method, and cause), psychiatric disorders, and physical diseases. METHODS: Data on a total of 28,670 suicide deaths from 2013 to 2017, provided by the Korea Foundation for Suicide Prevention, were analyzed. The study design employed a time-series analysis with a two-stage approach. In the first step, a generalized additive model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the short-term effect of PM exposure on suicide risk specific to each city. In the second step, the estimated results from each city were pooled through a meta-analysis to derive the overall effect. We determined the effects of single lag, cumulative lag, and moving average PM concentrations from days 0-7 before suicide. RESULTS: We confirmed an association between exposure to PM10 (≤ 10 μm in diameter) and deaths due to suicide. In particular, among individuals with psychiatric disorders and those who employed non-violent suicide methods, increased exposure to PM10 was associated with a higher risk of death by suicide, with percentage changes of 5.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.95-7.92) and 11.47 (95% CI: 7.95-15.11), respectively. Furthermore, in the group with psychiatric disorders, there was an observed tendency of increasing suicide risk as PM10 levels increased up to 120 µg/m3, whereas in the group with non-violent suicide deaths, there was a pronounced trend of rapid increase in suicide risk with an increase in PM10 up to 100 µg/m3. CONCLUSIONS: These results show an association between short-term exposure to PM and suicide. Our study adds evidence for the benefits of reducing PM in preventing diseases and improving mental health.",

      "title": "A critical review of PM10-mortality time-series studies.",
      "abstract": "While the mortality effects of particulate matter (PM) have been obvious during extreme historical pollution episodes (e.g., the London Fog of 1952), evaluating effects at more routine pollution levels has required the use of complex statistical modeling approaches. This paper critically reviews available time-series studies on PM10 mortality to provide a common basis for an evaluation of the PM10-mortality association. These PM10 studies confirm that an acute pollution-mortality association can occur at routine ambient levels, and suggest that such effects extend below the present United States air quality standards, especially for susceptible subpopulations. Furthermore, these new PM10 studies are consistent with the hypothesis noted in past studies that PM is a causal agent in the mortality impacts of air pollution. The relative risks (RRs) for PM10 mortality, however, were found to vary across studies. Variation probably was caused by differences in PM10 composition and in the PM10 averaging period employed in the analysis, as well as differences in whether other pollutants were considered simultaneously in the mortality-PM10 model. Overall, the RR estimates derived from available PM10-total mortality studies suggest a 24-h average, 100 micrograms/m3 PM10 acute exposure effect on the order of RR approximately 1.05-1.10 in the general population. Higher PM10 RRs were indicated for the elderly and for those with preexisting respiratory conditions, both of which represent subpopulations who appear to be especially at risk for the mortality implications of acute exposures to air pollution. A key research question remaining involves a determination of the component or components of PM10 (e.g., fine particles, sulfates, acid aerosols, or ultrafine particles) that are most important to the noted acute PM-mortality associations.",

      "abstract": "Recent epidemiological findings have suggested that urban atmospheric pollution may have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system as well as on the respiratory system. We carried out an exhaustive search of published studies investigating links between coronary heart disease and urban atmospheric pollution. The review was conducted on cited articles published between 1994 and 2005 and whose main objective was to measure the risk of ischaemic heart diseases related to urban pollution. Of the 236 references identified, 46 epidemiological studies were selected for analysis on the basis of pre-defined criteria. The studies were analysed according to short-term effects (time series and case-crossover designs) and long-term effects (case-control and cohort studies). A link between coronary heart disease and at least one of the pollutants studied (PM10, O3, NOx, CO, SO2) emerged in 40 publications. Particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide were the pollutants most often linked with coronary heart disease. The association was inconstant for O3. Although the mean mortality or morbidity risk related to urban atmospheric pollution is low compared with that associated with other better-known risk factors, its impact on health is nevertheless major because of the large number of people who are exposed. This exhaustive review supports the possibility that urban pollution is indeed an environmental cardiovascular risk factor and should be considered as such by the cardiologists.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive, systematic synthesis was conducted of daily time-series studies of air pollution and mortality from around the world. Estimates of effect sizes were extracted from 109 studies, from single- and multipollutant models, and by cause of death, age, and season. Random effects pooled estimates of excess all-cause mortality (single-pollutant models) associated with a change in pollutant concentration equal to the mean value among a representative group of cities were 2.0% (95% CI 1.5-2.4%) per 31.3 microg/m3 particulate matter (PM) of median diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10); 1.7% (1.2-2.2%) per 1.1 ppm CO; 2.8% (2.1-3.5%) per 24.0 ppb NO2; 1.6% (1.1-2.0%) per 31.2 ppb O3; and 0.9% (0.7-1.2%) per 9.4 ppb SO2 (daily maximum concentration for O3, daily average for others). Effect sizes were generally reduced in multipollutant models, but remained significantly different from zero for PM10 and SO2. Larger effect sizes were observed for respiratory mortality for all pollutants except O3. Heterogeneity among studies was partially accounted for by differences in variability of pollutant concentrations, and results were robust to alternative approaches to selecting estimates from the pool of available candidates. This synthesis leaves little doubt that acute air pollution exposure is a significant contributor to mortality.",

      "title": "Association of Fine Particulate Matter Exposure With Bystander-Witnessed Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest of Cardiac Origin in Japan.",
      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) are a major public health concern and a leading cause of death worldwide. Exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality and has been recognized as a leading contributor to global disease burden. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between short-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5) and the incidence of OHCAs of cardiac origin and with the development of initial cardiac arrest rhythm. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study used data from cases registered between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2016, in the All-Japan Utstein Registry, a prospective, nationwide, population-based database for OHCAs across all 47 Japanese prefectures. These OHCA cases included patients who had bystander-witnessed OHCAs and for whom emergency medical services responders initiated resuscitation before hospital transfer. A case-crossover design was employed for the study analyses. A prefecture-specific, conditional logistic regression model to estimate odds ratios was applied, and a random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain prefecture-specific pooled estimates. All analyses were performed from May 7, 2019, to January 23, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with the incidence of bystander-witnessed OHCAs of cardiac origin. The differences in the distribution of initial cardiac arrest rhythm in OHCAs among those with exposure to PM2.5 were also examined. RESULTS: In total, 103 189 OHCAs witnessed by bystanders were included in the final analysis. Among the patients who experienced such OHCAs, the mean (SD) age was 75 (15.5) years, and 62 795 (60.9%) were men. Point estimates of the percentage increase for a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag0-1 (difference in mean PM2.5 concentrations measured on the case day and 1 day before) demonstrated a statistically significantly higher incidence of OHCA across most of the 47 prefectures, without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 20.1%; P = .12). A stratified analysis found an association between PM2.5 exposure and OHCAs (% increase, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1%-3.1%). An initial shockable rhythm, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (% increase, 0.6; 95% CI, -2.0% to 3.2%), was not associated with PM2.5 exposure. However, an initial nonshockable rhythm, such as pulseless electrical activity and asystole, was associated with PM2.5 exposure (% increase, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.1%-2.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this study suggest that increased PM2.5 concentration is associated with bystander-witnessed OHCA of cardiac origin that commonly presents with nonshockable rhythm. The results support measures to reduce PM2.5 exposure to prevent OHCAs of cardiac origin.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Exposure to PM2.5 will increase the risk of respiratory disease and increase the burden of social health care. Astragaloside Ⅳ (Ast-IV) is one of the main biologically active substances form Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, which owns various pharmacological effects. Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by accumulation of iron-dependent lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is not clear whether there are typical features of ferroptosis in PM2.5-induced lung injury. This study investigates whether PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice has a special form of ferroptosis and the specific protective mechanism of Ast-IV. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7 per group): NS group (normal saline), Ast group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg), PM2.5 group, Ast-L group (Ast-IV 50 mg/kg + PM2.5), Ast-H group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + PM2.5) and Era group (Ast-IV 100 mg/kg + erastin 20 mg/kg + PM2.5). Mice were pre-treated with Ast-IV intraperitoneally for three days. Then, PM2.5 (7.5 mg/kg) was given by non-invasive tracheal instillation to induce lung injury. The ferroptosis' agonist erastin was used to verify the mechanism of Ast-IV anti-ferroptosis. 12 h after PM2.5 stimulation, the mice were euthanized. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected for oxidative stress and cytokine determination. Lung tissues were collected for glutathione (GSH), tissue iron content, histology, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Ast-IV reduced the lung wet-dry ratio and the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in serum. Ast-IV could also improve the oxidative stress level in BALF, restore the GSH level in the lung tissue, and reduce the iron content in the lung tissue. Western blot outcomes revealed that Ast-IV regulated the ferroptosis signaling pathway via the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to protect PM2.5-mediated lung injury. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice might be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis in lung tissue. Anti-ferroptosis might be a new mechanism of Ast-IV on PM2.5-induced lung injury.",

      "abstract": "Urban air pollution is a serious worldwide problem due to its impact on human health. In the past 60 years, growing evidence established a correlation between exposure to air pollutants and the developing of severe respiratory diseases. Recently particulate matter (PM) is drawing more public attention to various aspects including historical backgrounds, physicochemical characteristics, and its pathological role. Therefore, this review is focused on these aspects. The most famous air pollution disaster happened in London on December 1952; it has been calculated that more than 4,000 deaths occurred during this event. Air pollution is a complex mix of gases and particles. Gaseous pollutants disseminate deeply into the alveoli, allowing its diffusion through the blood-air barrier to several organs. Meanwhile, PM is a mix of solid or liquid particles suspended in the air. PM is deposited at different levels of the respiratory tract, depending on its size: coarse particles (PM10) in upper airways and fine particles (PM2.5) can be accumulated in the lung parenchyma, inducing several respiratory diseases. Additionally to size, the composition of PM has been associated with different toxicological outcomes on clinical and epidemiological, as well as in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies. PM can be constituted by organic, inorganic, and biological compounds. All these compounds are capable of modifying several biological activities, including alterations in cytokine production, coagulation factors balance, pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, and cardiac function. It can also generate different modifications during its passage through the airways, like inflammatory cells recruitment, with the release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These inflammatory mediators can activate different pathways, such as MAP kinases, NF-κB, and Stat-1, or induce DNA adducts. All these alterations can mediate obstructive or restrictive respiratory diseases like asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and even cancer. In 2013, outdoor air pollution was classified as Group 1 by IARC based on all research studies data about air pollution effects. Therefore, it is important to understand how PM composition can generate several pulmonary pathologies.",

      "title": "The association between air pollutions and emergency hospitalizations due to COPD and asthma across 16 Polish cities: population-based study.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In recent years numerous initiatives aimed at reducing air pollution have been undertaken in Poland. The general objective was to examine the correlation between air pollution measured by the level of particulate matter ≤10 μm in diameter (PM10) and emergency hospitalizations due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in 16 Polish cities (capitals of the regions). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors aimed to diagnose the situation across 16 cities over a 5‑year period (2014-2019). Data on the number of hospitalizations was retrieved from the national public insurance system, the National Health Fund. A total number of 22 600 emergency hospitalizations was analyzed (12 000 and 10 600 in 2014 and 2019, respectively). The data on air pollution was accessed via the public register of the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection air quality database. The authors of this article have used the data on PM10 daily exposure in each of the 16 cities in 2014 and 2019. Statistical methods included: non-parametric tests, a 2-stage modelling approach for time-series data, and multivariate meta-analysis of the results. RESULTS: The results indicated that there was a statistically significant decrease in PM10 concentration in 2019 in comparison to 2014 in all cities, mainly in the autumn and winter season. However, the correlation between the improvement in the air quality and a decrease in emergency hospitalizations due to asthma and COPD turned out to not be as strong as expected. The authors observed a strong correlation between PM10 concentrations and hospitalizations due to asthma and COPD, but only when air quality norms were significantly above acceptable levels. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution measured by PM10 concentration might be used as one of the predictors of the asthma and COPD emergency hospitalization risk, yet other factors like respiratory tract infection, health care organizational aspect, patient self-control, compliance and comorbidities should also be taken into consideration.

In this study, the authors performed a literature review and conducted a multisite time-series analysis of hospital admissions and exposure to PM(2.5) constituents (elemental carbon, organic carbon matter, sulfate, and nitrate) in a population of 12 million US Medicare enrollees for the period 2000-2008. The literature review illustrated a general lack of multiconstituent models or insight about probabilities of differential impacts per unit of concentration change. Consistent with previous results, the multisite time-series analysis found statistically significant associations between short-term changes in elemental carbon and cardiovascular hospital admissions. Posterior probabilities from multiconstituent models provided evidence that some individual constituents were more toxic than others, and posterior parameter estimates coupled with correlations among these estimates provided necessary information for risk assessment. Ratios of constituent toxicities, commonly used in risk assessment to describe differential toxicity, were extremely uncertain for all comparisons. These analyses emphasize the subtlety of the statistical techniques and epidemiologic studies necessary to inform risk assessments of particle constituents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on the association between short-term exposure to desert dust and health outcomes is controversial. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the short-term effects of particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) on mortality and hospital admissions in 13 Southern European cities, distinguishing between PM10 originating from the desert and from other sources. METHODS: We identified desert dust advection days in multiple Mediterranean areas for 2001-2010 by combining modeling tools, back-trajectories, and satellite data. For each advection day, we estimated PM10 concentrations originating from desert, and computed PM10 from other sources by difference. We fitted city-specific Poisson regression models to estimate the association between PM from different sources (desert and non-desert) and daily mortality and emergency hospitalizations. Finally, we pooled city-specific results in a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: On average, 15% of days were affected by desert dust at ground level (desert PM10 > 0 μg/m3). Most episodes occurred in spring-summer, with increasing gradient of both frequency and intensity north-south and west-east of the Mediterranean basin. We found significant associations of both PM10 concentrations with mortality. Increases of 10 μg/m3 in non-desert and desert PM10 (lag 0-1 days) were associated with increases in natural mortality of 0.55% (95% CI: 0.24, 0.87%) and 0.65% (95% CI: 0.24, 1.06%), respectively. Similar associations were estimated for cardio-respiratory mortality and hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: PM10 originating from the desert was positively associated with mortality and hospitalizations in Southern Europe. Policy measures should aim at reducing population exposure to anthropogenic airborne particles even in areas with large contribution from desert dust advections.

      "abstract": "Short-term effects of air pollutants on respiratory mortality and morbidity have been consistently reported but usually studied separately. To more completely assess air pollution effects, we studied hospitalisations for respiratory diseases together with out-of-hospital respiratory deaths. A time-stratified case-crossover study was carried out in six Italian cities from 2001 to 2005. Daily particulate matter (particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm (PM10)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) associations with hospitalisations for respiratory diseases (n = 100 690), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 38 577), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among COPD patients (n = 9886) and out-of-hospital respiratory deaths (n = 5490) were estimated for residents aged ≥35 years. For an increase of 10 μg·m(-3) in PM10, we found an immediate 0.59% (lag 0-1 days) increase in hospitalisations for respiratory diseases and a 0.67% increase for COPD; the 1.91% increase in LRTI hospitalisations lasted longer (lag 0-3 days) and the 3.95% increase in respiratory mortality lasted 6 days. Effects of NO2 were stronger and lasted longer (lag 0-5 days). Age, sex and previous ischaemic heart disease acted as effect modifiers for different outcomes. Analysing multiple rather than single respiratory events shows stronger air pollution effects. The temporal relationship between the pollutant increases and hospitalisations or mortality for respiratory diseases differs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of air pollution on hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the largest Brazilian metropolis. METHODS: This study was carried out at the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Brazil. Environmental data were obtained from the network of monitoring stations of nine municipalities. Air pollution exposure was measured by daily means of PM10 (particles with a nominal mean aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm) per municipality, while daily counts of hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases within the Brazilian Unified Health System were the outcome. For each municipality a time series analysis was carried out in which a semiparametric Poisson regression model was the framework to explain the daily fluctuations on counts of hospitalizations over time. The results were combined in a meta-analysis to estimate the overall risk of PM10 in hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases at the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. RESULTS: Regarding hospitalizations for respiratory diseases, the effect estimates were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all municipalities, except Santo André and Taboão da Serra. The RR (Relative Risk) of this outcome for an increase of 10 µg/m3 in the levels of PM10 ranged from 1.011 (95%CI 1.009-1.013) for São Paulo to 1.032 (95%CI 1.024-1.040) in São Bernardo do Campo. The RR of hospitalization for respiratory diseases in children for an increase of 10 µg/m3 of PM10 ranged from 1.009 (95%CI 1.001-1.017) in Santo André to 1.077 (95%CI 1.056-1.098) in Mauá. Only São Paulo and São Bernardo do Campo presented positive and statistically significant results for hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to estimate the risk of illness from air pollution in the set of municipalities of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Brazil. Global estimates of the effect of exposure to pollution in the region indicated associations only with respiratory diseases. Only São Paulo and São Bernardo do Campo showed an association between the levels of PM10 and hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o impacto da poluição do ar na maior metrópole brasileira sobre as internações por doenças respiratórias e cardiovasculares. MÉTODOS: Foi realizado estudo com dados das estações de monitoramento de nove municípios da Região Metropolitana de São Paulo, tendo o PM10 como indicador de poluição e as internações por doenças respiratórias e cardiovasculares como indicadores de efeito. Para cada município foi realizada uma análise de séries temporais usando modelos explicativos para contagens de internações ao longo do tempo via regressão de Poisson semi-paramétrica. Os resultados foram combinados em uma meta-análise de modo a estimar o risco global do PM10 na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo. RESULTADOS: Todos os municípios apresentaram estimativas estatisticamente significantes para as hospitalizações por doenças respiratórias com exceção de Santo André e Taboão da Serra. Os riscos relativos de admissão hospitalar para um aumento de 10 µg/m3 nos níveis de PM10 variaram de 1,011 (IC95% 1,009–1,013) para São Paulo a 1,032 (IC95% 1,024–1,040) em São Bernardo do Campo, para doenças respiratórias totais. O risco de internação por doenças respiratórias em crianças variou de 1,009 (IC95% 1,001–1,017) em Santo André a 1,077 (IC95% 1,056–1,098) em Mauá. Somente São Paulo e São Bernardo do Campo apresentaram resultados positivos e estatisticamente significantes para internações por doenças cardiovasculares. CONCLUSÕES: Esse é o primeiro estudo a estimar o risco de adoecimento devido à poluição do ar no conjunto de municípios da Região Metropolitana de São Paulo. As estimativas globais do efeito da exposição à poluição na região indicaram associações somente com as doenças respiratórias. Apenas São Paulo e de São Bernardo do Campo mostraram associação entre os níveis de PM10 e as internações por doenças cardiovasculares.",

      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, 91% of the global population was living in places where guidelines on air quality were not met, which results in an estimated figure of seven million deaths annually. The new Brazilian air quality standards, CONAMA 491/2018, was the first revision in over two decades and has as final target the WHO guidelines for air quality, although no deadline has been established for implementation. The goal of this work was to quantify public health gains of this new policy based on hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, the most studied outcome in Brazilian time series studies, in four Brazilian Southeast capitals: São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Belo Horizonte (MG), and Vitória (ES) for PM10, PM2,5, SO2, CO, and O3. Population and hospitalizations data for all respiratory diseases for people under 5 years old, over 64 years old, most vulnerable populations, and all ages were analyzed. The air quality monitoring data was analyzed in two different periods: 2016 to 2018 for São Paulo and Vitória; and between 2015 and 2017 for Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro, according to available monitoring data. A literature review was carried out to determine the appropriate relative risk to be used in the estimations, and the public health gains were calculated based on the selected relative risks for each city. The highest estimate was for São Paulo, with 3454 avoidable respiratory hospital admissions (all ages). In total, the four cities accounted for 4148 avoidable hospitalizations, which was associated to $1.1 million public health gains. Results considering the day of exposure (lag 0) were superior to those with the 5-day moving average (lag 5). The results highlighted the importance of adopting more restrictive standards and called for public policies, the necessity of expanding the air quality monitoring network, mapping emission sources, and improve the knowledge about the interaction between air pollution and health outcomes beyond respiratory disease for the region.",

OBJECTIVE: To measure the relationship between particles with diameter below 10 microm (PM10) and emergency ambulance dispatches (EAD). METHODS: Daily EAD for six towns of the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy) were obtained from a database collecting real-time data. Time series analyses were performed, and city-specific estimates were combined using meta-analytic techniques. RESULTS: We found a significant percentage change of EAD associated with a 10 microg/m3 increase of PM10 for non-traumatic diseases (0.86%, 95% CI: 0.61,1.1%). A positive relationship was also found for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases without reaching statistical significance. The risks were much higher in the warm (April-September) than in the cold season (January-March and October-December). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency ambulance dispatches provide useful insight into the health effects of air pollution and may be useful to establish surveillance systems.",

Daily counts of hospital admission for ischemic stroke were collected in 5 hospitals in China during November 2013 to October 2015. Daily concentrations of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were collected in 5 cities where the hospitals were located. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to examine the hospital-specific PM-ischemic stroke association after controlling for potential confounders. Then the effect estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. A total of 68,122 hospital admissions for ischemic stroke were identified from 5 hospitals during the study period. The pooled results showed that exposures to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with increased hospital admission for ischemic stroke on the current day and previous 1 day. The RRs (relative risk associated with per 10 μg/m3 increase in each pollutant) and 95%CIs (confidence intervals) for the cumulative effects of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 on ischemic stroke during lag 0-1 days were 1.014 (1.005, 1.0023), 1.007 (1.000, 1.014) and 1.005 (1.001, 1.009), respectively. In total, 3.5%, 3.6% and 4.1% of hospital admissions for ischemic stroke could be attributable to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Exposures to ambient PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 pollution showed acute adverse effects on hospital admission for ischemic stroke. The health effects of PM1 should be considered by policy-makers.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) has multiple adverse effects on human health, high temperatures are also associated with adverse health outcomes, and the frequency of cardiovascular events (CVEs) varies with season. We investigated a hypothesized increase in PM-related accident and emergency (A&E) presentations for CVE with high temperature, warm season, days of high influenza incidence, and in people with a cancer diagnosis, using a time-stratified case-crossover study design. Outcomes were associations of A&E presentation for CVE with atmospheric PM ≤ 10 μm (PM10), season, and air temperature. PM10 levels in the municipality of residence (exposure variable) were estimated by modeling data from local monitoring stations. Conditional logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for presentations in relation to supposed influencers, adjusting for confounders. Study participants were all who presented at the A&E of a large hospital near Milan, Italy, for a CVE (ICD-9: 390-459) from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2015. There were 1349 A&E presentations for CVE in 2014-2015 and 5390 control days. Risk of A&E presentation was significantly increased on hot days with OR 1.34 (95%CI 1.05-1.71) per 10 μg/m3 PM10 increment (as mean PM10 on day of presentation, and 1 and 2 days before (lags 0-2)), and (for lag 0) in autumn (OR 1.23, 95%CI 1.09-1.37) and winter (OR 1.18, 95%CI 1.01-1.38). Risks were also significantly increased when PM10 was on lag 1, in people with a cancer diagnosis in the spring and summer months (1.88, 95%CI 1.05-3.37), and on days (lags 0-2) of high influenza incidence (OR 2.34, 95%CI 1.01-5.43). PM10 levels exceeded the 50 μg/m3 \"safe\" threshold recommended by the WHO and Italian legislation for only 3.8% of days during the warm periods of 2014-2015. Greater risk of A&E presentation for CVE in periods of high PM10 and high temperature suggests that \"safe\" thresholds for PM10 should be temperature-dependent and that the adverse effects of PM10 will increase as temperatures increase due to climate change.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There are few studies about the association between breathing polluted air and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and cardiac death in the Middle East. This study aimed to investigate the relation between air pollutants and cardiovascular mortality (based on ICD-10) in Ahvaz. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this ecological study, the data about cardiovascular disease mortality and air pollutants from March 2008 until March 2015 was inquired from the Ahvaz City Authority and the Khuzestan Province Environmental Protection Agency. The quasi-Poisson, second degree polynomial constrained, distributed lag model; using single and cumulative lag structures, adjusted by trend, seasonality, temperature, relative humidity, weekdays and holidays was used for the data analysis purposes. RESULTS: Findings indicated a direct significant relation between an interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone and cardiovascular deaths among men after 3 days' lag. There was also a significant relation between an IQR increase in particulate matter below 10 μm and cardiovascular deaths for all people, over 60 years old and under 18 years old after 3 and 13 days' lags. There was a significant relation between an IQR increase in nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, and cardiovascular deaths in the case of under 18-year-olds (in the lag 11) and over 60-year-olds (in the lag 9), respectively. We finally found a significant association between an IQR increase in sulfur dioxide and cardiovascular deaths in the case of men, under 18-year-olds and from 18- to 60-year-olds in the lag 9, 0, and 11, respectively (p-values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that air pollution is significantly associated with cardiovascular deaths in Ahvaz City. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2018;31(4):459-473.",

      "title": "Short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Short-term exposure (from one hour to days) to selected air pollutants has been associated with human mortality. This systematic review was conducted to analyse the evidence on the effects of short-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less or equal than 10 and 2.5 µm (PM10, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on all-cause mortality, and PM10 and PM2.5 on cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular mortality. METHODS: We included studies on human populations exposed to outdoor air pollution from any source, excluding occupational exposures. Relative risks (RRs) per 10 µg/m3 increase in air pollutants concentrations were used as the effect estimates. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using 80% prediction intervals. Risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies was analysed using a new domain-based assessment tool, developed by a working group convened by the World Health Organization and designed specifically to evaluate RoB within eligible air pollution studies included in systematic reviews. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses by age, sex, continent, study design, single or multicity studies, time lag, and RoB. The certainty of evidence was assessed for each exposure-outcome combination. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018087749). RESULTS: We included 196 articles in quantitative analysis. All combinations of pollutants and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were positively associated in the main analysis, and in a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The only exception was NO2, but when considering a 1-hour maximum exposure. We found positive associations between pollutants and all-cause mortality for PM10 (RR: 1.0041; 95% CI: 1.0034-1.0049), PM2.5 (RR: 1.0065; 95% CI: 1.0044-1.0086), NO2 (24-hour average) (RR: 1.0072; 95% CI: 1.0059-1.0085), and O3 (RR: 1.0043; 95% CI: 1.0034-1.0052). PM10 and PM2.5 were also positively associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular mortality. We found some degree of heterogeneity between studies in three exposure-outcome combinations, and this heterogeneity could not be explained after subgroup analysis. RoB was low or moderate in the majority of articles. The certainty of evidence was judged as high in 10 out of 11 combinations, and moderate in one combination. CONCLUSIONS: This study found evidence of a positive association between short-term exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3 and all-cause mortality, and between PM10 and PM2.5 and cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular mortality. These results were robust through several sensitivity analyses. In general, the level of evidence was high, meaning that we can be confident in the associations found in this study.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked to occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI); however, only a limited number of studies investigated its association with death from MI, and the results remain inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the association of short-term exposure to air pollution across a wide range of concentrations with MI mortality. METHODS: A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted to investigate 151,608 MI death cases in Hubei province (China) from 2013 to 2018. Based on each case's home address, exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide, and ozone on each of the case and control days was assessed as the inverse distance-weighted average concentration at neighboring air quality monitoring stations. Conditional logistic regression models were implemented to quantify exposure-response associations. RESULTS: Exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 (mean exposure on the same day of death and 1 day prior) was significantly associated with increased odds of MI mortality. The odds associated with PM2.5 and PM10 exposures increased steeply before a breakpoint (PM2.5, 33.3 μg/m3; PM10, 57.3 μg/m3) and flattened out at higher exposure levels, while the association for NO2 exposure was almost linear. Each 10-μg/m3 increase in exposure to PM2.5 (<33.3 μg/m3), PM10 (<57.3 μg/m3), and NO2 was significantly associated with a 4.14% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25% to 7.12%), 2.67% (95% CI: 0.80% to 4.57%), and 1.46% (95% CI: 0.76% to 2.17%) increase in odds of MI mortality, respectively. The association between NO2 exposure and MI mortality was significantly stronger in older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was associated with increased risk of MI mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between air pollution and stroke has been extensively studied, however, the evidence regarding the association between air pollution and hospitalization due to stroke and its subtypes in coastal areas of China is limited. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the associations between air pollution and hospitalizations of stroke and its subtypes in the Beibu Gulf Region of China. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study in 15 cities in Beibu Gulf Region in China from 2013 to 2016. Exposures to PM1, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO on the case and control days were assessed at residential addresses using bilinear interpolation. Conditional logistic regressions were constructed to estimate city-specific associations adjusting for meteorological factors and public holidays. Meta-analysis was further conducted to pool all city-level estimates. RESULTS: There were 271,394 case days and 922,305 control days. The odds ratios (ORs) for stroke hospitalizations associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in 2-day averages of SO2 (IQR: 10.8 µg/m3), NO2 (IQR: 11.2 µg/m3), and PM10 (IQR: 37 µg/m3) were 1.047 (95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1.015-1.080), 1.040 (95 % CI: 1.027-1.053), and 1.018 (95 % CI: 1.004-1.033), respectively. The associations with hospitalizations of ischemic stroke were significant for all seven pollutants, while the association with hemorrhagic stroke was significant only for CO. The associations of SO2, NO2, and O3 with stroke hospitalization were significantly stronger in the cool season. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term increase in SO2, NO2, and PM10 might be important triggers of stroke hospitalization. All seven air pollutants were associated with ischemic stroke hospitalization, while only CO was associated with hemorrhagic stroke hospitalization. These results should be considered in public health policy.",

      "abstract": "Mineral dust is one of the largest natural constituents of coarse particulate matter (PM10). Most of these dust emissions originate from northern Africa, and several hundred tera-grams of dust are emitted annually from this region. Previous evidence has linked dust PM10 to adverse respiratory outcomes in children. However, most of these studies have been from high-income countries (HICs) or examined dust from other regions of the world, mainly Asia. Evidence from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa is scarce. Respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of under-five mortality across the globe. However, there is a poignant disparity in studies examining these outcomes in children in the region where most dust is emitted. This study linked remotely sensed satellite data to a nationally representative survey to examine acute exposure to dust in children living in Benin using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis. We identified acute effects of exposure to dust and increased risk of cough in children under five. The effect of increased risk is strongest within two weeks of exposure and dissipates by four weeks. Children living in rural areas and households with lower income had a greater risk of adverse respiratory outcomes when exposed to dust. We could elucidate the specific period and conditions of increased risk for respiratory problems in children living in Benin.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Upper Northern Thailand (UNT) has been episodically affected by air pollution from vegetation burning, which causes adverse respiratory health effects. However, no study has evaluated the effect of regulatory actions to prohibit vegetation burning on respiratory morbidity. We examined the effect of a burning ban enforced in May 2016 on hospital visits for respiratory diseases in UNT. METHODS: This study used data from eight provinces in UNT. Analyses were conducted for January to April of 2014-2016 (before ban enforcement) and January to April of 2017-2018 (after ban enforcement). Particulate matter of 10 microns in diameter or smaller (PM10) concentrations, numbers of satellite fire hotspots and age-standardized rates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases before and after ban enforcement were compared. The effect of the ban on hospital visits for respiratory diseases was evaluated using an interrupted time-series analysis controlled for season-specific temporal trends, day of week, public holiday, temperature, relative humidity, number of hospitals and offset population, with gastrointestinal diseases as a negative control. A meta-analysis was performed to pool province-specific effect estimates. RESULTS: The daily average PM10 concentration and the number of fire hotspots decreased after ban enforcement in all provinces in UNT, with percent changes ranging from 5.3 to 34.3% and 14.3 to 81.5%, respectively. The adjusted pooled effect estimates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases decreased by 9.1% (95% CI: 5.1, 12.9), whereas a null association was observed for gastrointestinal diseases. CONCLUSION: The burning ban had a positive impact on both air pollution levels and rates of hospital visits for respiratory diseases in UNT.",

      "abstract": "Background and Purpose- Evidence on the effects of coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5) on ischemic stroke is limited and inconsistent. We evaluated the acute effects of PM10-2.5 exposure on hospital admissions for ischemic stroke in China. Methods- We conducted a national time-series analysis of associations between daily PM10-2.5 concentrations and daily hospital admissions for ischemic stroke in China between January 2014 and December 2016. Hospital admissions for ischemic stroke were identified from the database of Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance, which contains data from 0.28 billion beneficiaries. We applied a city-specific Poisson regression to examine the associations of PM10-2.5 and daily ischemic stroke admissions. We combined the city-specific effect estimates with a random effects meta-analysis, and further evaluated the exposure-response relationship curve and potential effect modifiers. Results- We identified >2 million hospital admissions for ischemic stroke in 172 Chinese cities. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10-2.5 concentrations (lag day 0) was associated with a 0.91% (95% CI, 0.73-1.10) increase in hospital admissions for ischemic stroke. The association remained significant after adjusting for PM2.5 (percentage change, 0.96%; 95% CI, 0.75-1.18). The exposure-response relationship was approximately linear, with a moderate response at lower levels (<200 μg/m3) and a steeper response at higher levels. The association was stronger in cities with lower PM10-2.5 concentrations, higher temperatures, or higher relative humidity. Conclusions- This nationwide study provides robust evidence of the short-term association between exposure to PM10-2.5 and increased hospital admissions for ischemic stroke and supports the hypothesis that the association differs by city characteristics.",

      "title": "Association between short-term exposure to air pollutants and cause-specific daily mortality in Italy. A nationwide analysis.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Daily air pollution has been linked with mortality from urban studies. Associations in rural areas are still unclear and there is growing interest in testing the role that air pollution has on other causes of death. This study aims to evaluate the association between daily air pollution and cause-specific mortality in all 8092 Italian municipalities. METHODS: Natural, cardiovascular, cardiac, ischemic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, metabolic, diabetes, nervous and psychiatric causes of death occurred in Italy were extracted during 2013-2015. Daily ambient PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were estimated through machine learning algorithms. The associations between air pollutants and cause-specific mortality were estimated with a time-series approach using a two-stage analytic protocol where area-specific over-dispersed Poisson regression models where fit in the first stage, followed by a meta-analysis in the second. We tested for effect modification by sex, age class and the degree of urbanisation of the municipality. RESULTS: We estimated a positive association between PM10 and PM2.5 and the mortality from natural, cardiovascular, cardiac, respiratory and nervous system causes, but not with metabolic or psychiatric causes of death. In particular, mortality from nervous diseases increased by 4.55% (95% CI: 2.51-6.63) and 9.64% (95% CI: 5.76-13.65) for increments of 10 μg/m3 in PM10 and PM2.5 (lag 0-5 days), respectively. NO2 was positively associated with respiratory (6.68% (95% CI: 1.04-12.62)) and metabolic (7.30% (95% CI: 1.03-13.95)) mortality for increments of 10 μg/m3 (lag 0-5). Higher associations with natural mortality were found among the elderly, while there were no differential effects between sex or between rural and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to particulate matter was associated with mortality from nervous diseases. Mortality from metabolic diseases was associated with NO2 exposure. Other associations are confirmed and updated, including the contribution of lowly urbanised areas. Health effects were also found in suburban and rural areas.",

      "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developing countries, particularly for children and elderly. The main objective of this review paper is to review the epidemiological evidence about the effects of sociodemographic and climatic variability on pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections. A detailed literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus following PRISMA guidelines. The articles, which considered the effect of only climatic or both climatic and sociodemographic factors on pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, included in this review. A total thirty-four relevant articles were reviewed. Of 34 studies, only 14 articles (41%) examined the joint effects of sociodemographic and climate factors on pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections while most of them (59%) assessed climate factors separately. Among these fourteen, only three articles (8.8%) considered detailed sociodemographic factors. All of the reviewed articles suggested different degrees of positive or negative relationship of temperature with pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract infections. Fifteen (44%) articles suggested an association with relative humidity and 13 (38%) with rainfall. Only 3 articles (8.8%) found a relationship with wind speed. Three articles (8.8%) considered other risk factors such as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 (PM10). One study among the reviewed articles used spatial analysis methods but this study did not examine the joint effects. Among the reviewed articles, 18 (53%) articles used different time series models, one article (3%) used spatiotemporal time series model, 8 (23%) studies used other models and rest 7 (21%) studies used simple descriptive analysis. A total of 18 studies (53%) were conducted in Asia, most of them in China. There were 6 studies (17%) in Europe and 8 studies (23%) in America (South, North and Central). In Africa and Oceania, only one study was found for each region. The joint effect of climate and sociodemographic factors on pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections remain to be determined and further research is highly recommended for future prevention of this important and common disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: the association between air pollution and human health has been extensivelyinvestigated in the epidemiological literature. However, evidence in non-urban areasaffected by industrial activities is still limited. OBJECTIVES: to assess the association between daily exposure to PM10 and cause-specific mortality in municipalities affected by emissions from industrial plants during the period 2006-2015. DESIGN: two-stage time-series design was applied to assess the relationship between lagged PM10 and the outcomes. In the first stage, the association at the municipal level was analyzed with Poisson regression models adjusted for space-time confounders (trend and temperature). In the second stage, a mixed effects metanalysis of municipal estimates was applied to obtain a pooled estimate. Effect modification for individual variables (sex, age) and type of industrial site (chemical, steel, energy, or mining plant) was assessed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: using the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, industrial plants entailing a combustion process were selected. 4x4 km² buffer around the plant was constructed to select the municipalities to be included in the analysis. Daily PM10 was estimated using machine-learning models based on satellite data. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: daily counts of natural, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths. RESULTS: the average exposure to PM10 was 28.4 μg/m³ (±SD 16.9). During the period under study, 568,804 deaths from natural causes were observed in the 100 municipalities near the 61 industrial sites identified. Percentage risk variations for 10-units increments of lagged 0-1 PM10 were 1.04% (95%CI 0.67;1.41), 1.04% (95%CI -1.21;3.34), and 7.89% (95%CI 0.16;16.23) for natural, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. Higher risk estimates were observed in municipalities near steel plants, especially for respiratory mortality (8.13%; 95%CI -2.85;20.35). No differences were observed in estimates between different age and sex classes. CONCLUSIONS: although not fully able to capture the industrial component of pollution, the results indicate excess risk of mortality in residents of the municipalities under study, especially when considering the presence of steel plants.",

      "title": "Isolated and synergistic effects of PM10 and average temperature on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To analyze the effect of air pollution and temperature on mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. METHODS We evaluated the isolated and synergistic effects of temperature and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 µm (PM10) on the mortality of individuals > 40 years old due to cardiovascular disease and that of individuals > 60 years old due to respiratory diseases in Sao Paulo, SP, Southeastern Brazil, between 1998 and 2008. Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.e., average temperature or pollutant concentration. The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors. RESULTS No differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses. The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 μg/m3 in the PM10 concentration. The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures. The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively, when the pollution levels reached approximately 60 μg/m3. CONCLUSIONS The positive association standardized in the Poisson regression model for pollutant concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis. The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme concentrations. OBJETIVO: Analisar o efeito da poluição do ar e da temperatura na mortalidade por doenças cardiovasculares e respiratórias. MÉTODOS: Foram analisados os efeitos da temperatura e do material particulado com diâmetro aerodinâmico < 10 micrômetros (MP10), isolado e sinérgico, na mortalidade de indivíduos > 40 anos por doenças cardiovasculares e na mortalidade de indivíduos > 60 anos por doenças respiratórias em São Paulo, SP, entre 1998 e 2008. Três tipos de metodologias foram aplicadas para avaliar a associação isolada: análise de séries temporais com regressão de Poisson, análise case-crossover com pareamento temporal bidirecional e análise case-crossover com pareamento pelo fator confundidor, i.e., temperatura média ou poluente. Foi interpretada a representação gráfica da superfície resposta, gerada por termo de interação entre tais fatores adicionado à regressão de Poisson, para avaliar o efeito sinérgico entre os fatores de risco. RESULTADOS: Não foram observadas diferenças entre os resultados das análises case-crossover e de séries temporais. Estimou-se mudança percentual no risco relativo para mortalidade cardiovascular e respiratória de 0,85% (0,45;1,25) e 1,60% (0,74;2,46), respectivamente, devido ao aumento de 10 μg/m3 na concentração do MP10. O padrão de associação da temperatura para mortalidade cardiovascular foi de U-shape e para mortalidade respiratória foi de J-shape, representando maior risco relativo em temperaturas altas. As figuras do termo de interação indicaram maior risco relativo em baixas temperaturas para mortalidade cardiovascular e em altas temperaturas para mortalidade respiratória em níveis de poluição em torno de 60 μg/m3. CONCLUSÕES: A associação positiva parametrizada no modelo de regressão de Poisson para os poluentes não sofre confusão da temperatura, bem como o efeito da temperatura não sofre confusão dos níveis de poluentes na análise de séries temporais. A simultaneidade de exposição a diferentes níveis de fatores ambientais pode gerar condições de efeito combinado, tão preocupantes quanto as de extremas concentrações.",

      "abstract": "There is limited evidence available worldwide about the quantitative relationship between particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10µm (PM10) and years of life lost (YLL) caused by respiratory diseases (RD), especially regarding long-term time series data. We investigated the quantitative exposure-response association between PM10 and the disease burden of RD. We obtained the daily concentration of ambient pollutants (PM10, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide), temperature and relative humidity data, as well as the death monitoring data from 2001 to 2010 in Tianjin. Then, a time series database was built after the daily YLL of RD was calculated. We applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the burden of PM10 on daily YLL of RD and to determine the effect (the increase of daily YLL) of every 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 on health. We found that every 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with the greatest increase in YLL of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.23) years at a 2-day (current day and previous day, lag01) moving average PM10 concentration for RD. The association between PM10 and YLL was stronger in females and the elderly (≥65 years of age). The association between PM10 and YLL of RD differed according to district. These findings also provide new epidemiological evidence for respiratory disease prevention.",

      "abstract": "It is well established that exposure to ambient air pollution affects human health. A majority of literature concentrated on health effects of air pollution in high income countries. Only fewer studies analyzing health effects of air pollution in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) are available. To bridge this gap in literature, this study investigated short term and long-term health impacts of ambient air pollutants focussed in LMICs. We evaluated Total Non-accidental mortality, Respiratory Mortality, Stroke Mortality, Cardio-vascular Mortality, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) and Lung Cancer Mortality in LMICs particularly. Random Effects Model was utilised to derive overall risk estimate. Relative Risk (RR) estimates per 10 μg/m3 was used as input for model. Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis by Design and Country was conducted. A total of 152 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found positive associations between pollutants and Total Non-accidental mortality for PM10 ((RR:1.0043-1.0036), p < 0.0001), NO2 (RR:1.0222 (1.0111-1.0336), p < 0.0001), SO2 (RR:1.0107 - (1.0073-1.0140), p < 0.0001), O3 (RR: 1.0038 (1.0023-1.0053), p < 0.0001) and PM2.5 (RR: 1.0048 (1.0037-1.0059), p < 0.0001) for every 10 μg/m3 increase. We found positive association between Long-term exposure to PM10 and Total Non-accidental mortality (RR: 1.0430 (1.0278-1.0583), p < 0.0001) We also found statistically significant positive associations between pollutants and Cardiorespiratory and Cardiovascular morbidity. The positive associations persisted when analysed amongst sub-groups. However, the high heterogeneity amongst studies persisted even after performing sub-group analysis. The study has found statistically significant positive associations between short-term and long-term exposure to Ambient air pollution with various health-outcome combinations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Lombardy region in northern Italy ranks among the most air polluted areas of Europe. Previous studies showed air pollution short-term effects on all-cause mortality. We examine here the effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10µm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure on deaths and hospitalizations from specific causes, including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases. METHODS: We considered air pollution, mortality and hospitalization data for a non-opportunistic sample of 18 highly polluted and most densely populated areas of the region in the years 2003-2006. We obtained area-specific effect estimates for PM10 and NO2 from a Poisson regression model on the daily number of total deaths or cause-specific hospitalizations and then combined them in a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. For cause-specific mortality, we applied a case-crossover analysis. Age- and season-specific analyses were also performed. Effect estimates were expressed as percent variation in mortality or hospitalizations associated with a 10µg/m(3) increase in PM10 or NO2 concentration. RESULTS: Natural mortality was positively associated with both pollutants (0.30%, 90% Credibility Interval [CrI]: -0.31; 0.78 for PM10; 0.70%, 90%CrI: 0.10; 1.27 for NO2). Cardiovascular deaths showed a higher percent variation in association with NO2 (1.12%, 90% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14; 2.11), while the percent variation for respiratory mortality was highest in association with PM10 (1.64%, 90%CI: 0.35; 2.93). The effect of both pollutants was more evident in the summer season. Air pollution was also associated to hospitalizations, the highest variations being 0.77% (90%CrI: 0.22; 1.43) for PM10 and respiratory diseases, and 1.70% (90%CrI: 0.39; 2.84) for NO2 and cerebrovascular diseases. The effect of PM10 on respiratory hospital admissions appeared to increase with age. For both pollutants, effects on cerebrovascular hospitalizations were more evident in subjects aged less than 75 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a sound characterization of air pollution exposure and its potential effects on human health in the most polluted, and also most populated and productive, Italian region, further documenting the need for effective public health policies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have reported associations between ambient air pollution and mortality. However, relatively few studies have investigated this relationship in Brazil using individual-level data. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the short-term association between exposure to particulate matter <10 μm (PM10) and ozone (O3), and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2012 and 2017. METHODS: We used a time-stratified case-crossover study design with individual-level mortality data. Our sample included 76,798 deaths from cardiovascular diseases and 36,071 deaths from respiratory diseases. Individual exposure to air pollutants was estimated by the inverse distance weighting method. We used data from seven monitoring stations for PM10 (24-hour mean), eight stations for O3 (8-hour max), 13 stations for air temperature (24-hour mean), and 12 humidity stations (24-hour mean). We estimated the mortality effects of PM10 and O3 over a 3-day lag using conditional logistic regression models combined with distributed lag non-linear models. The models were adjusted for daily mean temperature and daily mean absolute humidity. Effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in each pollutant exposure. RESULTS: No consistent associations were observed for both pollutant and mortality outcome. The cumulative OR of PM10 exposure was 1.01 (95% CI 0.99-1.02) for respiratory mortality and 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.01) for cardiovascular mortality. For O3 exposure, we also found no evidence of increased mortality for cardiovascular (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01) or respiratory diseases (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00). Our findings were similar across age and gender subgroups, and different model specifications. CONCLUSION: We found no consistent associations between the PM10 and O3 concentrations observed in our study and cardio-respiratory mortality. Future studies need to explore more refined exposure assessment methods to improve health risk estimates and the planning and evaluation of public health and environmental policies.",

      "abstract": "Objectives To estimate the short term effect of particulate air pollution (particle diameter <10 μm, or PM10) on mortality and explore the heterogeneity of particulate air pollution effects in major cities in China.Design Generalised linear models with different lag structures using time series data.Setting 38 of the largest cities in 27 provinces of China (combined population >200 million).Participants 350 638 deaths (200 912 in males, 149 726 in females) recorded in 38 city districts by the Disease Surveillance Point System of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 1 January 2010 to 29 June 2013.Main outcome measure Daily numbers of deaths from all causes, cardiorespiratory diseases, and non-cardiorespiratory diseases and among different demographic groups were used to estimate the associations between particulate air pollution and mortality.Results A 10 µg/m3 change in concurrent day PM10 concentrations was associated with a 0.44% (95% confidence interval 0.30% to 0.58%) increase in daily number of deaths. Previous day and two day lagged PM10 levels decreased in magnitude by one third and two thirds but remained statistically significantly associated with increased mortality. The estimate for the effect of PM10 on deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases was 0.62% (0.43% to 0.81%) per 10 µg/m3 compared with 0.26% (0.09% to 0.42%) for other cause mortality. Exposure to PM10 had a greater impact on females than on males. Adults aged 60 and over were more vulnerable to particulate air pollution at high levels than those aged less than 60. The PM10 effect varied across different cities and marginally decreased in cities with higher PM10 concentrations.Conclusion Particulate air pollution has a greater impact on deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases than it does on other cause mortality. People aged 60 or more have a higher risk of death from particulate air pollution than people aged less than 60. The estimates of the effect varied across cities and covered a wide range of domain.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has shown the effects of air pollution on respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality, but the evidence is still inconclusive to date. We conducted a time-series analysis, which included 10388 subjects, to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality in Hefei, China, from 2009 to 2015. The mean concentrations of pollutants (PM10, NO2 and SO2) were 106.35, 30.40, and 20.66 μg/m3, respectively, during the study period. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 was associated with 7.69% (95%CI: 3.41%-12.15%), 4.38% (95%CI: 1.33%-7.53%), and 1.55% (95%CI: 0.80%-2.30%) increase of respiratory diseases mortality, respectively. In contrast, lung cancer mortality was only significantly associated with SO2 level. Subgroup analyses showed that female in respiratory disease patients were more sensitive to air pollution than male. Studies about seasonality of pollutants on respiratory and lung cancer mortality were inconsistent. Further analyses with multiple-pollutant model showed that the effects of pollutants were generally decreased after the other pollutants were adjusted, except the effects of SO2 on lung cancer. These findings demonstrated that air pollution could evidently increase the respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coarse particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) air pollution is a severe environmental problem in developing countries, but its challenges to public health were rarely evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations between day-to-day changes in [Formula: see text] and cause-specific mortality in China. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide daily time-series analysis in 272 main Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015. The associations between [Formula: see text] concentrations and mortality were analyzed in each city using overdispersed generalized additive models. Two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate national and regional average associations, and random-effect models were used to pool city-specific concentration-response curves. Two-pollutant models were adjusted for fine particles with aerodynamic diameter [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) or gaseous pollutants. RESULTS: Overall, we observed positive and approximately linear concentration-response associations between [Formula: see text] and daily mortality. A [Formula: see text] increase in [Formula: see text] was associated with higher mortality due to nonaccidental causes [0.23%; 95% posterior interval (PI): 0.13, 0.33], cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; 0.25%; 95% PI: 0.13, 0.37), coronary heart disease (CHD; 0.21%; 95% PI: 0.05, 0.36), stroke (0.21%; 95% PI: 0.08, 0.35), respiratory diseases (0.26%; 95% PI: 0.07, 0.46), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 0.34%; 95% PI: 0.12, 0.57). Associations were stronger for cities in southern vs. northern China, with significant differences for total and cardiovascular mortality. Associations with [Formula: see text] were of similar magnitude to those for [Formula: see text] in both single- and two-pollutant models with mutual adjustment. Associations were robust to adjustment for gaseous pollutants other than nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Meta-regression indicated that a larger positive correlation between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] predicted stronger city-specific associations between [Formula: see text] and total mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis showed significant associations between short-term [Formula: see text] exposure and daily nonaccidental and cardiopulmonary mortality based on data from 272 cities located throughout China. Associations appeared to be independent of exposure to [Formula: see text], carbon monoxide, and ozone. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2711.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: the health status of people living near industrial plants is often exposed to several environmental risk factors, including air pollution. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between daily PM10 levels and cause-specific mortality in a selection of municipalities near two industrial plants from 2006 to 2015. DESIGN: a time-series design with Poisson regression adjusted for a predefined set of confounders was used to quantify the association between exposure, calculated as daily PM10 levels extrapolated from machine-learning models using satellite data, and cause-specific mortality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: twenty municipalities near the thermal power plants in Civitavecchia and Brindisi were selected. The municipalities were then divided into three scenarios of chronic exposure derived from SPRAY simulation models of pollutant deposition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: daily cause-specific non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths defined according to the International Classification of Diseases code at the municipality level. RESULTS: a total of 41,942 deaths were observed in the entire area (10,503 in the Civitavecchia area and 31,439 in the Brindisi area), of which approximately 41% were due to cardiovascular causes and 8% due to respiratory causes. The association showed an increase in shortterm effects in municipalities with higher chronic levels of pollution exposure. For example, risk estimates reported as percentage increases per 10-unit increase in PM10 were 6.7% (95% CI 0.9, 12.7%) in scenario 3 (highest exposure) compared to 4.2% (-1.2, 9.9%) and 2.7% (-4.2, 10.2%) in scenarios 2 and 1, respectively, in the area near the Civitavecchia plant. Similar effects were observed for the Brindisi area. CONCLUSIONS: despite the well-documented relationship between short-term pollution and mortality, it appears that greater chronic exposure to industrial pollutants leads to increased short-term effects of PM10. The limited number of events suggests that this study could serve as a starting point for a larger investigation.",

      "abstract": "Significant associations have been reported between particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 mm (PM10) and ozone ambient concentrations, and daily number of deaths from respiratory causes. The aim of the present study was to assess such associations among elderly (> or =65 yrs) residents of Mexico City. Ambient air pollution data were provided by the Metropolitan Monitoring Network. During the study period, the average daily PM10 ranged 23.4-175.3 microg x m(-3), and ozone 1 h daily maximums ranged 39.4-216.7 ppb. Information was compiled on the primary and underlying causes of death. The analyses were conducted separately according to place of death (within or out of a hospital unit) using time-series methodology. The total number of deaths from all respiratory causes and mortality for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) were significantly related to PM10 over different lags: an increase of 10 microg x m(-3) was related to a 2.9% (95% (CI): 0.9-4.9%) increase and to a 4.1% (95% CI: 1.3%-6.9%) increase with a 3-day lag when death occurred out of medical units, respectively. For deaths occurring in medical units, a longer lag and smaller risk estimate was observed. An interactive effect between PM10 and ozone was detected. This study confirms that there is an important impact of PM10 on respiratory morbidity among elderly subjects. It also indicates that accounting for primary and underlying causes of death, and considering place of death may reduce misclassification and provide more accurate estimates of the adverse impact of PM10 on mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although epidemiologic studies have shown associations between particle mass and daily mortality, evidence on other particle metrics is weak. OBJECTIVES: We investigated associations of size-specific particle number concentration (PNC) and lung-deposited particle surface area concentration (PSC) with cause-specific daily mortality in contrast to PM10. METHODS: We used time-series data (March 2009-December 2014) on daily natural, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality (NM, CVM, RM) of three adjacent cities in the Ruhr Area, Germany. Size-specific PNC (electric mobility diameter of 13.3-750 nm), PSC, and PM10 were measured at an urban background monitoring site. In single- and multipollutant Poisson regression models, we estimated percentage change (95% confidence interval) [% (95% CI)] in mortality per interquartile range (IQR) in exposure at single-day (0-7) and aggregated lags (0-1, 2-3, 4-7), accounting for time trend, temperature, humidity, day of week, holidays, period of seasonal population decrease, and influenza. RESULTS: PNC100-750 and PSC were highly correlated and had similar immediate (lag0-1) and delayed (lag4-7) associations with NM and CVM, for example, 1.12% (95% CI: 0.09, 2.33) and 1.56% (95% CI: 0.22, 2.92) higher NM with IQR increases in PNC100-750 at lag0-1 and lag4-7, respectfully, which were slightly stronger then associations with IQR increases in PM10. Positive associations between PNC and NM were strongest for accumulation mode particles (PNC 100-500 nm), and for larger UFPs (PNC 50-100 nm). Associations between NM and PNC<100 changed little after adjustment for O3 or PM10, but were more sensitive to adjustment for NO2. CONCLUSION: Size-specific PNC (50-500 nm) and lung-deposited PSC were associated with natural and cardiovascular mortality in the Ruhr Area. Although associations were similar to those estimated for an IQR increase in PM10, particle number size distributions can be linked to emission sources, and thus may be more informative for potential public health interventions. Moreover, PSC could be used as an alternative metric that integrates particle size distribution as well as deposition efficiency. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2054.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a vast body of literature covering the association between air pollution exposure and nonaccidental mortality. However, the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in this relationship is still not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: We investigated if individual and contextual SES modified the relationship between short-term exposure to ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 µm (PM10) on cardiovascular, respiratory, and all nonaccidental mortality. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study. Analyses were based on information on 280,685 deaths from 2011 to 2015 in the city of São Paulo. Education was used as an individual SES, and information on the district of residence was used to build a contextual SES. Exposure to PM10, NO2, and O3 was accessed from monitoring stations and linked to each case based on the date of death. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of air pollutants, and interaction terms were added to access the effect modification of SES. RESULTS: Individuals with lower education had an increased chance of dying for all nonaccidental outcomes (1.54% [0.91%, 2.14%]) associated with exposure to PM10. Individuals living in lower SES areas had an increased chance of dying for nonaccidental (0.52% [0.16%, 0.88%]), cardiovascular (1.17% [0.88%, 1.46%]), and respiratory (1.70% [0.47%, 2.93%]) causes owing to NO2 exposure. CONCLUSION: Exposure to air pollutants increases the chance of dying by nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes. Lower educational levels and living on lower contextual SES increased the risk of mortality associated with air pollution exposure.",

The effect estimates per 10-µg/m(3) increase in PM10 concentrations at the moving average of lags of 0 and 1 day on high-temperature days were 2.34% (95% confidence interval = 0.55, 4.16) for nonaccidental, 1.35% (-1.69, 4.48) for cardiovascular, 6.09% (2.42, 9.89) for respiratory, and 3.36% (0.92, 5.86) for cardiopulmonary mortalities. The results suggest that it is important to control and reduce the emission of air particles in Guangzhou, particularly on extreme-high-temperature days.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of PM10 exposure in low concentration areas on the daily hospitalized patients with coronary heart disease. Methods: Daily air quality monitoring data, meteorological monitoring data and daily hospitalization data of coronary heart disease during 2019−2021 in Ganzhou, China were collected. Generalized additive model and distributed lag nonlinear model were used to evaluate the association between environmental PM10 and daily hospital visits for coronary heart disease. Stratified by sex and age to see their potential impact on this association. Results: PM10 exposure was correlated with an increased risk of hospitalization in coronary heart disease patients. Single-pollutant model analysis shows that at the day of lag1, for every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10, the risk of coronary heart disease hospitalization increased by 1.69% (95%CI 0.39~3.00%); Subgroup analysis showed that females and older adults (>65 years) were more sensitive to PM10 exposure. In addition, in the dual-pollutant model, by adjusting other pollutants (including SO2, CO and O3), it was found that the relationship between PM10 exposure and coronary heart disease hospitalization was robust. And with changing the model’s degree of freedom was still robust. Conclusion: Short-term exposure to low concentrations of PM10 is associated with hospitalization for coronary heart disease. These results are important for local environmental public health policy development, so as to protect vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfire imposes a high mortality burden on Brazil. However, there is a limited assessment of the health economic losses attributable to wildfire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5). METHODS: We collected daily time-series data on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality from 510 immediate regions in Brazil during 2000-2016. The chemical transport model GEOS-Chem driven with Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), in combination with ground monitored data and machine learning was used to estimate wildfire-related PM2.5 data at a resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. A time-series design was applied in each immediate region to assess the association between economic losses due to mortality and wildfire-related PM2.5 and the estimates were pooled at the national level using a random-effect meta-analysis. We used a meta-regression model to explore the modification effect of GDP and its sectors (agriculture, industry, and service) on economic losses. RESULTS: During 2000-2016, a total of US$81.08 billion economic losses (US$5.07 billion per year) due to mortality were attributable to wildfire-related PM2.5 in Brazil, accounting for 0.68% of economic losses and equivalent to approximately 0.14% of Brazil's GDP. The attributable fraction (AF) of economic losses due to wildfire-related PM2.5 was positively associated with the proportion of GDP from agriculture, while negatively associated with the proportion of GDP from service. CONCLUSION: Substantial economic losses due to mortality were associated with wildfires, which could be influenced by the agriculture and services share of GDP per capita. Our estimates of the economic losses of mortality could be used to determine optimal levels of investment and resources to mitigate the adverse health impacts of wildfires.",

      "title": "Coarse Particulate Air Pollution and Daily Mortality: A Global Study in 205 Cities.",
      "abstract": "Rationale: The associations between ambient coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) and daily mortality are not fully understood on a global scale. Objectives: To evaluate the short-term associations between PM2.5-10 and total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries/regions worldwide. Methods: We collected daily mortality (total, cardiovascular, and respiratory) and air pollution data from 205 cities in 20 countries/regions. Concentrations of PM2.5-10 were computed as the difference between inhalable and fine PM. A two-stage time-series analytic approach was applied, with overdispersed generalized linear models and multilevel meta-analysis. We fitted two-pollutant models to test the independent effect of PM2.5-10 from copollutants (fine PM, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide). Exposure-response relationship curves were pooled, and regional analyses were conducted. Measurements and Main Results: A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5-10 concentration on lag 0-1 day was associated with increments of 0.51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18%-0.84%), 0.43% (95% CI, 0.15%-0.71%), and 0.41% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.77%) in total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. The associations varied by country and region. These associations were robust to adjustment by all copollutants in two-pollutant models, especially for PM2.5. The exposure-response curves for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were positive, with steeper slopes at lower exposure ranges and without discernible thresholds. Conclusions: This study provides novel global evidence on the robust and independent associations between short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5-10 and total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, suggesting the need to establish a unique guideline or regulatory limit for daily concentrations of PM2.5-10.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked with premature mortality, but sources of PM2.5 have been less studied. METHODS: We evaluated associations between source-specific PM2.5 exposures and cause-specific short-term mortality in eight California locations from 2002 to 2011. Speciated PM2.5 measurements were source-apportioned using Positive Matrix Factorization into eight sources and combined with death certificate data. We used time-stratified case-crossover analysis with conditional logistic regression by location and meta-analysis to calculate pooled estimates. RESULTS: Biomass burning was associated with all-cause mortality lagged 2 days after exposure (lag2) (% changelag2 in odds per interquartile range width increase in biomass burning PM2.5 = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2, 1.4), cardiovascular (% changelag2 = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.3, 2.4), and ischemic heart disease (% changelag2 = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.6, 3.5). Vehicular emissions were associated with increases in cardiovascular mortality (% changelag0 = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.0, 2.9). Several other sources exhibited positive associations as well. Many findings persisted during the cool season. Warm season biomass burning was associated with respiratory/thoracic cancer mortality (% changelag1 = 5.9, 95% CI = 0.7, 11.3), and warm season traffic was associated with all-cause (% changelag0 = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.1, 3.6) and cardiovascular (% changelag0 = 2.9, 95% CI = 0.1, 5.7) mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that acute exposures to biomass burning and vehicular emissions are linked with cardiovascular mortality, with additional sources (i.e., soil, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, aged sea salt, and chlorine sources) showing associations with other specific mortality types.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The link between PM2.5 exposure and adverse health outcomes is well documented from studies across the world. However, the reported effect estimates vary across studies, locations and constituents. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and mortality using city-specific estimates, and explore factors that may explain some of the observed heterogeneity. METHODS: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies on particle constituents and mortality using PubMed and Web of Science databases up to July 2015.We included studies that examined the association between short-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, in the general adult population. Each study was summarized based on pre-specified study key parameters (e.g., location, time period, population, diagnostic classification standard), and we evaluated the risk of bias using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Method for each included study. We extracted city-specific mortality risk estimates for each constituent and cause of mortality. For multi-city studies, we requested the city-specific risk estimates from the authors unless reported in the article. We performed random effects meta-analyses using city-specific estimates, and examined whether the effects vary across regions and city characteristics (PM2.5 concentration levels, air temperature, elevation, vegetation, size of elderly population, population density, and baseline mortality). RESULTS: We found a 0.89% (95% CI: 0.68, 1.10%) increase in all-cause, a 0.80% (95% CI: 0.41, 1.20%) increase in cardiovascular, and a 1.10% (95% CI: 0.59, 1.62%) increase in respiratory mortality per 10μg/m3 increase in PM2.5. Accounting for the downward bias induced by studies of single days, the all-cause mortality estimate increased to 1.01% (95% CI: 0.81, 1.20%). We found significant associations between mortality and several PM2.5 constituents. The most consistent and stronger associations were observed for elemental carbon (EC) and potassium (K). For most of the constituents, we observed high variability of effect estimates across cities. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that (a) combustion elements such as EC and K have a stronger association with mortality, (b) single lag studies underestimate effects, and (c) estimates of PM2.5 and constituents differ across regions. Accounting for PM mass in constituent's health models may lead to more stable and comparable effect estimates across different studies. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42017055765.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution has been widely associated with increased mortality and years of life lost (YLL) from various diseases. However, no study has assessed that the effects of air pollution on overall YLL were due to increased number of mortalities or average YLL per death. METHODS: We first conducted a time-series study from 2013 to 2016, covering six Chinese megacities. Generalized additive models with a Gaussian link were utilized to estimate the associations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with daily overall YLL and average YLL per death from various causes, including non-accidental causes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases (RD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), stroke and acute myocardial infraction (AMI). The city-specific estimates were then pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,586,741 deaths from non-accidental causes and 21,916,857 YLLs were recorded in the six cities, providing an average of 13.81 daily YLLs per death. Significant effects of PM2.5 and NO2 on daily overall YLL and daily mortality count were observed, but there were no significant effects on average YLL per death. At the pooled level, each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with increased YLL and higher mortality due to non-accidental causes [PM2.5: 5.45 years, 95% CI: 1.47, 9.42 and ERR (excess relative risk) = 0.25%, 95% CI: 0.14%, 0.35%; NO2: 20.46 years, 95% CI: 10.77, 30.15 and ERR = 1.13%, 95% CI: 0.63%, 1.63%]. Consistent results and patterns were observed for other cause-specific diseases, including IHD, COPD, stroke and AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates observed associations between air pollution and YLL might be mainly induced by increasing mortality count, rather than increasing average life lost for each death. More relevant intervention should be performed to reduce the number of deaths due to air pollution.",

      "abstract": "While fine mode particulate matter (PM(2.5)) forms the basis for regulating particles in the US and other countries, there is a serious paucity of large population-based studies of its acute effect on mortality. To address this issue, we examined the association between PM(2.5) and both all-cause and specific-cause mortality using over 1.3 million deaths in 27 US communities between 1997 and 2002. A two-stage approach was used. First, the association between PM(2.5) and mortality in each community was quantified using a case-crossover design. Second, meta-analysis was used to estimate a summary effect over all 27 communities. Effect modification of age and gender was examined using interaction terms in the case-crossover model, while effect modification of community-specific characteristics including geographic location, annual PM(2.5) concentration above 15 microg/m(3) and central air conditioning prevalence was examined using meta-regression. We observed a 1.21% (95% CI 0.29, 2.14%) increase in all-cause mortality, a 1.78% (95% CI 0.20, 3.36%) increase in respiratory related mortality and a 1.03% (95% CI 0.02, 2.04%) increase in stroke related mortality with a 10 microg/m(3) increase in previous day's PM(2.5). The magnitude of these associations is more than triple that recently reported for PM(10), suggesting that combustion and traffic related particles are more toxic than larger sized particles. Effect modification occurred in all-cause and specific-cause deaths with greater effects in subjects >or=75 years of age. There was suggestive evidence that women may be more susceptible to PM(2.5) effects than men, and that effects were larger in the East than in the West. Increased prevalence of central air conditioning was associated with a decreased effect of PM(2.5). Our findings describe the magnitude of the effect on all-cause and specific-cause mortality, the modifiers of this association, and suggest that PM(2.5) may pose a public health risk even at or below current ambient levels.",

      "abstract": "Small particles can reach alveoli without being trapped in the upper respiratory tract and may have a greater impact on health than larger particles. Given the limited knowledge on health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Japan, the short-term effects of PM2.5 on daily mortality using the generalized additive model (GAM), generalized linear model (GLIM), and time-stratified case-crossover analysis were estimated. Daily mortality data were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Air pollution and meteorological data in 20 areas were obtained from the National Institute for Environmental Studies and the Japan Meteorological Agency, respectively. The three methods were compared, adjusting for meteorological variables and co-pollutants, for area-specific analyses and combined area-specific results using meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Daily mortality for elderly aged 65 and over varied from 0.5 to 127.3 by area. The 24-hr mean concentration of PM2.5 ranged from 11.8 to 22.8 microg/m3. Area-specific analyses revealed regional heterogeneity. Furthermore, combined results showed that a 10-microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 for the single-pollutant model at lag1 was associated with a 0.53, 0.77, and 0.88% increase in all-cause mortality for the GAM, GLIM, and case-crossover analysis, respectively. These findings provide robust evidence for the short-term effects of air pollutants on daily mortality in Japan and suggest that differences in estimates obtained from different statistical models should be considered when multipollutant models are used.",

      "title": "Health effects of wildfire PM2.5 in Latin American cities: A rapid systematic review and comparative synthesis.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Wildfire activity is intensifying in Latin America due to climate and land-use changes, but the health impacts of wildfire-derived PM2.5 in urban areas remain poorly quantified and recognized. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence on wildfire-related PM2.5 and its association with mortality and morbidity in Latin American cities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, using data from PubMed, Scopus, and Bireme. One reviewer independently screened 163 articles and extracted data from 14 eligible studies. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 12) and used time-series or modelling designs to estimate health risks. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure was associated with allcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Reported effect estimates ranged from 1.7 to 7.7% increases in risk per 10 μg/m³ of exposure. Other studies assessed preterm birth, COVID-19 outcomes, and site-specific cancers. While two studies provided harmonized RR estimates for all-cause mortality, high heterogeneity and methodological differences prevented formal meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Wildfire smoke contributes measurably to premature mortality in Latin America, but current evidence is unevenly distributed across regions, time periods, and population subgroups. Studies rarely capture the disproportionate risks faced by indigenous and rural communities or the intraurban disparities linked to poverty and geography. Future research should focus on the health burden of morbidity linked to wildfire PM2.5. INTRODUCCIÓN: La actividad de incendios forestales se está intensificando en América Latina debido al cambio climático y al uso del suelo, pero los impactos en la salud del material particulado fino (PM2.5) derivado de estos incendios en áreas urbanas siguen estando poco cuantificados y reconocidos. OBJETIVO: Evaluar la evidencia sobre el PM2.5 relacionado con incendios forestales y su asociación con la mortalidad y morbilidad en ciudades latinoamericanas. MATERIALES Y MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática rápida y un metaanálisis siguiendo las directrices PRISMA, utilizando datos de PubMed, Scopus y BIREME. Un revisor examinó de forma independiente 163 artículos y extrajo datos de 14 estudios elegibles. Se llevó a cabo una evaluación del riesgo de sesgo utilizando la escala de Newcastle–Ottawa. RESULTADOS: La mayoría de los estudios se realizaron en Brasil (n=12) y emplearon diseños de series temporales o modelos para estimar los riesgos para la salud. La exposición a PM2.5 específico de incendios se asoció con mortalidad por todas las causas, cardiovascular y respiratoria. Las estimaciones de efecto reportadas oscilaron entre aumentos del 1.7% al 7.7% en el riesgo por cada incremento de 10 µg/m³ de exposición. Otros estudios evaluaron parto prematuro, desenlaces por COVID-19 y cánceres específicos por sitio. Aunque dos estudios proporcionaron estimaciones armonizadas de riesgo relativo para la mortalidad por todas las causas, la alta heterogeneidad y las diferencias metodológicas impidieron realizar un meta-análisis formal. CONCLUSIONES: El humo de incendios forestales contribuye de manera significativa a la mortalidad prematura en América Latina, pero la evidencia actual está distribuida de forma desigual entre regiones, períodos de tiempo y subgrupos poblacionales. Rara vez se capturan los riesgos desproporcionados que enfrentan las comunidades indígenas y rurales, o las disparidades intraurbanas vinculadas a la pobreza y la geografía. Las investigaciones futuras deberían centrarse en la carga de morbilidad asociada al PM2.5 de incendios forestales.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: From around 2012, the use of automated equipment for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measurement with equivalence to a reference method has become popular nationwide in Japan. This enabled us to perform a national health effect assessment employing PM2.5 concentrations based on the standardized measurement method. We evaluated the association between non-accidental mortality and short-term exposure to PM2.5 and coarse particulate matter (PM), with the latter estimated as the difference between suspended particulate matter and PM2.5, for the fiscal years 2012-2014. METHODS: This was a time-stratified case-crossover study in 100 highly-populated Japanese cities. Mortality data was obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. City-specific estimates of PM-mortality association were calculated by applying a conditional logistic regression analysis, and combined with a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The respective averages of daily mean concentration were 14.6 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 6.4 µg/m3 for coarse PM. A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations for the average of the day of death and the previous day was associated with an increase of 1.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.6%) in total non-accidental mortality. For cause-specific mortality, PM2.5 was positively associated with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. After adjustment for PM2.5, we observed a 1.4% (95% CI, 0.2-2.6%) increase in total mortality with a 10 µg/m3 increase in coarse PM. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that short-term exposure to PM2.5 had adverse effects on total non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in Japan. Coarse PM exposure also increased the risk of total mortality.",

      "abstract": "Health effects attributable to air pollution exposure in Chinese population have been least understood. The authors conducted a meta-analysis on 33 time-series and case-crossover studies conducted in China to assess mortality effects of short-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 and 2.5 μm (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO). Significant associations between air pollution exposure and increased mortality risks were observed in the pooled estimates for all pollutants of interest. In specific, each 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.38% (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.31, 0.45) increase in total mortality, a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.30, 0.73) in respiratory mortality, and a 0.44% (95% CI: 0.33, 0.54) in cardiovascular mortality. When current annual PM2.5 levels in mega-Chinese cities to be reduced to the WHO Air Quality Guideline (AQG) of 10 μg/m(3), mortality attributable to short-term exposure to PM2.5 could be reduced by 2.7%, 1.7%, 2.3%, and 6.2% in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an, respectively. The authors recommend future studies on the nature of air pollution concentration and health effect relationships in Chinese population to support setting stringent air quality standards to improve public health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although many studies have examined the effects of air pollution on mortality, data limitations have resulted in fewer studies of both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <or= 2.5 microm (PM(2.5); fine particles) and of coarse particles (particles with an aerodynamic diameter > 2.5 and < 10 microm; PM coarse). We conducted a national, multicity time-series study of the acute effect of PM(2.5) and PM coarse on the increased risk of death for all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and respiratory mortality for the years 1999-2005. METHOD: We applied a city- and season-specific Poisson regression in 112 U.S. cities to examine the association of mean (day of death and previous day) PM(2.5) and PM coarse with daily deaths. We combined the city-specific estimates using a random effects approach, in total, by season and by region. RESULTS: We found a 0.98% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.22] in total mortality, a 0.85% increase (95% CI, 0.46-1.24) in CVD, a 1.18% increase (95% CI, 0.48-1.89) in MI, a 1.78% increase (95% CI, 0.96-2.62) in stroke, and a 1.68% increase (95% CI, 1.04-2.33) in respiratory deaths for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in 2-day averaged PM(2.5). The effects were higher in spring. For PM coarse, we found significant but smaller increases for all causes analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our analysis showed an increased risk of mortality for all and specific causes associated with PM(2.5), and the risks are higher than what was previously observed for PM(10). In addition, coarse particles are also associated with more deaths.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Desert dust and sandstorms raise concerns about their adverse effects on human health. Over the last decade, special attention has been given to mineral dust particles from desert sand. However, evidence from previous literature reviews has yielded inconclusive results regarding their health effects. We aim to systematically synthesize evidence on the short-term health effects of desert dust exposure from major dust source areas. METHODS: The bibliographic search was conducted using the MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science databases to investigate the health effects of short-term exposure to desert dust in human populations, using time series or case-crossover study designs. Study selection and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We evaluated the risk of bias (RoB) for individual studies and the certainty of evidence (CoE) for environmental exposures, as developed by a group of experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO). Publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Begg's asymmetry test. RESULTS: A total of 71 studies were included in the review, covering data from 1993 to 2024. Most studies focused on Asian and African desert dust, with fewer studies from Arabian, American, and Australian regions. We found a significant increase in the risk for all-cause mortality (Relative Risk, RR = 1.0121, 95 %CI = [1.0045, 1.0199]). In addition, the mortality risk associated with particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10) was slightly higher on dust days compared to non-dust days, while for particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), the risk was higher on non-dust days. We also observed a significant increase in the risk for cardiovascular mortality (RR = 1.0252, 95 % CI = [1.0100, 1.0407]) during dust days compared to non-dust days, but not for respiratory mortality (RR = 1.0001, 95 % CI = [0.9773, 1.0277]). The risk also increased for cardiovascular (RR = 1.0094, 95 % CI = [1.0014, 1.0174]) and respiratory morbidity (RR = 1.0693, 95 % CI = [1.0188, 1.1224]). CONCLUSION: Exposure to desert dust and sandstorms is linked to increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as respiratory morbidity. The overall evidence quality for each exposure-outcome combination was assessed as moderate, although data limitations prevent the establishment of specific air quality thresholds for desert dust particles. This review highlights the need for targeted public health interventions in affected regions.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, PM2.5 and O3 have been the two main pollutants affecting public health in China, but the interaction of the two pollutants on human health remains unclear. A two-stage analytical approach was used to investigate the relationships of PM2.5-O3 co-pollution with nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality levels across 14 cities in China. We first utilized a generalized additive model (GAM) to determine the city-specific associations of PM2.5 and O3 with daily mortality. The associations were then combined at the national and regional levels using meta-analysis. To investigate the potential interactions between the two pollutants and cause-specific mortality, we performed stratified analyses by co-pollutant exposure levels and the synergy index (SI) (SI > 1 indicates a synergistic interaction). The effect of changes in the two pollutants' concentrations (in 10 μg/m3 increases) on mortality was assessed. The stratification analysis results suggested that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag0-1 (lag01) in the low, moderate, and high strata of the O3 concentrations increased nonaccidental mortality by 0.07% (95% confidence interval: -0.03%, 0.17%), 0.33% (0.13%, 0.53%), and 0.68% (0.30%, 1.06%), respectively, with significant between-group differences (p < 0.001). Moreover, each 10 μg/m3 increase in O3 (lag01) in the low, moderate, and high strata of the PM2.5 concentrations increased nonaccidental mortality by 0.15% (-0.06%, 0.36%), 0.53% (0.19%, 0.87%), and 0.75% (0.14%, 1.36%), respectively, with significant between-group differences (p < 0.001). We also found substantial synergistic interactions between the two pollutants and nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality levels, with SI values of 1.48, 1.51, and 1.33, respectively. Additionally, a subgroup analysis revealed that the interaction of these two pollutants on nonaccidental mortality were greater in South China compared to elsewhere, and during the warm season compared to during the cold season. Our findings suggested that the simultaneous control of PM2.5 and O3 within the context of combined air pollution could significantly decrease the disease risk, especially in southern China and during the warm season.",

Each 10-μg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 (lag01) was associated with an increase of 0.38% (95% confidence interval = 0.21%-0.55%) in all causes mortality, 0.96% (0.46%-1.46%) in cardiovascular mortality, and 1% (0.23%-1.78%) in respiratory mortality. Each 10-μg/m(3) increase in PM10-2.5 (lag01) was associated with cardiovascular mortality (0.69%, [0.05%-1.33%]), although this association attenuated after controlling for other pollutants, especially PM2.5. Increased mortality was associated with increasing PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 concentrations over 11 East Asian cities.",

      "title": "National Particle Component Toxicity (NPACT) Initiative: integrated epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of the health effects of particulate matter components.",
      "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM*), an ambient air criteria pollutant, is a complex mixture of chemical components; particle sizes range from nanometer-sized molecular clusters to dust particles that are too large to be aspirated into the lungs. Although particle composition is believed to affect health risks from PM exposure, our current health-based air quality standards for PM are limited to (1) the mass concentrations of PM2.5 (particles 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter), which are largely attributable to combustion products; and (2) PM10 (10 microm or smaller), which includes larger-sized mechanically generated dusts. Both of these particle size fractions are regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and both have been associated with excess mortality and morbidity. We conducted four studies as part of HEI's integrated National Particle Component Toxicity (NPACT) Initiative research program. Since 1999, the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN), managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S; EPA), has routinely gathered air monitoring data every third or sixth day for the concentrations of numerous components of PM2.5. Data from the CSN enabled us to conduct a limited time-series epidemiologic study of short-term morbidity and mortality (Ito study); and a study of the associations between long-term average pollutant concentrations and annual mortality (Thurston study). Both have illuminated the roles of PM2.5 chemical components and source-related mixtures as potentially causal agents. We also conducted a series of 6-month subchronic inhalation exposure studies (6 hours/day, 5 days/week) of PM2.5 concentrated (nominally) 10 x from ambient air (CAPs) with apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice (a mouse model of atherosclerosis) (Chen study). The CAPs studies were conducted in five different U.S. airsheds; we measured the daily mass concentrations of PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and 16 elemental components in order to identify their sources and their roles in eliciting both short- and long-term health-related responses. In addition, from the same five air-sheds we collected samples of coarse (PM10-2.5), fine (PM2.5-0.2), and ultrafine (PM0.2) particles. Aliquots of these samples were administered to cells in vitro and to mouse lungs in vivo (by aspiration) in order to determine their comparative acute effects (Gordon Study). The results of these four complementary studies, and the overall integrative analyses, provide a basis for guiding future research and for helping to determine more targeted emission controls for the PM components most hazardous to acute and chronic health. Application of the knowledge gained in this work may therefore contribute to an optimization of the public health benefits of future PM emission controls. The design of each NPACT study conducted at NYU was guided by our scientific hypotheses, which were based on our reviews of the background literature and our experience in conducting studies of associations between ambient PM and health-related responses. These hypotheses guided the development and conduct of the four studies. Hypothesis 1. Coarse, fine, and ultrafine PM are each capable of producing acute health effects of public health concern, but the effects may differ according to particle size and composition. (Applies to all studies.) Hypothesis 2. Long-term PM2.5 exposures are closely associated with chronic health effects. (Applies to studies 1 and 4.) Hypothesis 3. The source-apportionment techniques that we have developed and refined in recent years provide a useful basis for identifying major categories of sources of PM in ambient air and specific chemical components that have the greatest impacts on a variety of acute and chronic health effects. (Applies to all studies.) Hypothesis 4. The health effects due to ambient PM exposures can best be seen in sensitive subgroups within overall human populations and in animal models of such populations. (Applies to studies 1, 3, and 4.) Overall, the studies have demonstrated that the toxicity of PM is driven by a complex interaction of particle size range, geographic location, source category, and season. These findings suggest that the components of PM--associated with certain categories of sources--are responsible for the observed adverse health effects. Most importantly, the responsible components and source categories vary with the health-related endpoints being assessed. Across all studies, fossil-fuel combustion source categories were most consistently associated with both short- and long-term adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure. The components that originate from the Residual Oil Combustion and Traffic source categories were most closely associated with short-term effects; and components from the Coal Combustion category were more closely associated with long-term effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: to compare the meta-analysis and the pooled analysis approach to study short-term effects of air pollution on human health in Emilia-Romagna Region (Central Italy) cities, characterised by strong homogeneity of environmental and sociodemographic features. METHODS: application of fixed-effects meta-analysis and fixed-effects pooled analysis on time-series data of seven cities in Emilia-Romagna in the period 2006-2010. The relationship among adverse health events (deaths due to natural causes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease) and concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 was investigated by means of GAM models, using the EpiAir protocol. RESULTS: the pooled analysis application entailed a gain in terms of precision of effect estimates in respect to meta-analysis approach. The interval widths of pooled analysis are lower than those of meta-analytic estimates, with percentage reductions between 7% and 43%. This power increase led to a major number of statistically significant pooled analysis estimates. It has been a generally good correspondence between the two methods in terms of direction and strength of the association among health outcomes and the various pollutants. An exception is the PM10 effect estimate on respiratory mortality, where the meta-analytic estimate was significantly higher and not in line with literature data. CONCLUSIONS: the study highlighted the increase in accuracy and stability of effect estimates obtained from a pooled analysis compared to a meta-analysis in a regional context such as the Emilia-Romagna Region, characterised by the absence of heterogeneity in exposure to pollutants and other confounders. In this context, the pooled approach is to be considered preferable to meta-analysis.",

      "abstract": "We conducted a multicity time-series study using monitoring data to assess seasonal patterns of short-term ozone-mortality association among elderly aged 65 years and over in Japan. Daily exposure to ambient ozone was computed using hourly measurements of photochemical oxidants available at multiple monitoring stations in each city. Effects of ozone on daily all-cause non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were estimated using distributed lag linear models, controlling for confounding by temporal, day of the week, temperature, and flu epidemics. City-level effect estimates were combined using inverse variance meta-analysis. In spring and autumn, a 10-ppbv increase of daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentration in the previous 3 days was associated with 0.69 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.27-1.10), 1.07 % (0.34-1.82), and 1.77 % (0.78-2.77) increases in daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. Forward displacement of respiratory mortality was large during the cold season despite lower ozone concentration. Results were generally independent of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Findings suggest significant mortality effects of short-term ozone exposure among the elderly during the moderate season. Those with underlying respiratory diseases were susceptible, even during winter.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: this study aims at presenting the results from the Italian EpiaAir2 Project on the short-term effects of air pollution on adult population (35+ years old) in 25 Italian cities. DESIGN: the short-term effects of air pollution on resident people died in their city were analysed adopting the time series approach. The association between increases in 10µg/m(3) in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 air concentration and natural, cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality was studied. City-specific Poisson models were fitted to estimate the association of daily concentrations of pollutants with daily counts of deaths. The analysis took into account temporal and meteorological factors to control for potential confounding effect. Pooled estimates have been derived from random effects meta-analysis, evaluating the presence of heterogeneity in the city specific results. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: it was analysed 422,723 deaths in the 25 cities of the project among people aged 35 years or more, resident in each city during the period 2006-2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: daily counts of natural, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory mortality, obtained from the registries of each city. Demographic information were obtained by record linkage procedure with the civil registry of each city. RESULTS: mean number of deaths for natural causes ranged from 513 in Rovigo to 20,959 in Rome. About 25% of deaths are due to cardiac diseases, 10% to cerebrovascular diseases, and 7% to respiratory diseases. It was found an immediate effect of PM10 on natural mortality (0.51%; 95%CI 0.16-0.86; lag 0-1). More relevant and prolonged effects (lag 0-5) have been found for PM2.5 (0.78%; 95%CI 0.12-1.46) and NO2 (1.10%; 95%CI 0.63-1.58). Increases in cardiac mortality are associated with PM10 (0.93%; 95%CI 0.16-1.70) and PM2.5 (1.25%; 95%CI 0.17-2.34), while for respiratory mortality exposure to NO2 has an important role (1.67%; 95%CI 0.23-3.13; lag 2-5), as well as PM10 (1.41%; 95%CI - 0.23;+3.08). Results are strongly homogeneous among cities, except for respiratory mortality. No effect has been found for cerebrovascular mortality and weak evidence of association has been observed between ozone and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: a clear increase in mortality associated to air pollutants was observed. More important are the effects of NO2 (on natural mortality), mostly associated with traffic emissions, and of PM2.5 (on cardiac and respiratory mortality). Nitrogen dioxide shows an independent effect from the particulate matter, as observed in the bi-pollutant models.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global disease burden. The current evidence on the impact of air pollution on HF remains inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to provide a more comprehensive and multiperspective assessment of the associations between short- and long-term air pollution exposure and HF from epidemiological evidences. METHODS: Three databases were searched up to 31 August 2022 for studies investigating the association between air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and HF hospitalization, incidence, or mortality. A random effects model was used to derive the risk estimations. Subgroup analysis was conducted by geographical location, age of participants, outcome, study design, covered area, the methods of exposure assessment, and the length of exposure window. Sensitivity analysis and adjustment for publication bias were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Of 100 studies covering 20 countries worldwide, 81 were for short-term and 19 were for long-term exposure. Almost all air pollutants were adversely associated with the risk of HF in both short- and long-term exposure studies. For short-term exposures, we found the risk of HF increased by 1.8% [relative risk (RR)=1.018, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.011, 1.025] and 1.6% (RR=1.016, 95% CI: 1.011, 1.020) per 10-μg/m3 increment of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. HF was also significantly associated with NO2, SO2, and CO, but not O3. Positive associations were stronger when exposure was considered over the previous 2 d (lag 0-1) rather than on the day of exposure only (lag 0). For long-term exposures, there were significant associations between several air pollutants and HF with RR (95% CI) of 1.748 (1.112, 2.747) per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5, 1.212 (1.010, 1.454) per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM10, and 1.204 (1.069, 1.356) per 10-ppb increment in NO2, respectively. The adverse associations of most pollutants with HF were greater in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of our results. DISCUSSION: Available evidence highlighted adverse associations between air pollution and HF regardless of short- and long-term exposure. Air pollution is still a prevalent public health issue globally and sustained policies and actions are called for to reduce the burden of HF. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11506.",

PM2.5 is mostly absorbed through the respiratory system, where it can infiltrate the lung alveoli and reach the bloodstream. In the respiratory system, reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and oxidative stress stimulate the generation of mediators of pulmonary inflammation and begin or promote numerous illnesses. According to the most recent data, fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, is responsible for nearly 4 million deaths globally from cardiopulmonary illnesses such as heart disease, respiratory infections, chronic lung disease, cancers, preterm births, and other illnesses. There has been increased worry in recent years about the negative impacts of this worldwide danger.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Particulate matter (PM), a major component of ambient air pollution, accounts for a substantial burden of diseases and fatality worldwide. Maternal exposure to PM during pregnancy is particularly harmful to children's health since this is a phase of rapid human growth and development. METHOD: In this review, we synthesize the scientific evidence on adverse health outcomes in children following prenatal exposure to the smallest toxic components, fine (PM2.5) and ultrafine (PM0.1) PM. We highlight the established and emerging findings from epidemiologic studies and experimental models. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to fine and ultrafine PM directly and indirectly yields numerous adverse birth outcomes and impacts on children's respiratory systems, immune status, brain development, and cardiometabolic health. The biological mechanisms underlying adverse effects include direct placental translocation of ultrafine particles, placental and systemic maternal oxidative stress and inflammation elicited by both fine and ultrafine PM, epigenetic changes, and potential endocrine effects that influence long-term health. CONCLUSION: Policies to reduce maternal exposure and health consequences in children should be a high priority. PM2.5 levels are regulated, yet it is recognized that minority and low socioeconomic status groups experience disproportionate exposures. Moreover, PM0.1 levels are not routinely measured or currently regulated. Consequently, preventive strategies that inform neighborhood/regional planning and clinical/nutritional recommendations are needed to mitigate maternal exposure and ultimately protect children's health.",

      "title": "Impacts of Climate Change and Air Pollution on Neurologic Health, Disease, and Practice: A Scoping Review.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although the international community collectively seeks to reduce global temperature rise to less than 1.5°C before 2100, irreversible environmental changes have already occurred, and as the planet warms, these changes will continue to occur. As we witness the effects of a warming planet on human health, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how the epidemiology and incidence of neurologic disease may change. In this review, we organized our analysis around 3 key themes related to climate change and neurologic health: extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations, emerging neuroinfectious diseases, and pollutant impacts. Across each of these themes, we appraised and reviewed recent literature relevant to neurologic disease and practice. METHODS: Studies were identified using search terms relating to climate change, pollutants, and neurologic disease in PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and gray literature. Studies published between 1990 and 2022 were included if they pertained to human incidence or prevalence of disease, were in English, and were relevant to neurologic disease. RESULTS: We identified a total of 364 articles, grouped into the 3 key themes of our study: extreme weather events and temperature fluctuations (38 studies), emerging neuroinfectious diseases (37 studies), and pollutant impacts (289 studies). The included studies highlighted the relationships between neurologic symptom exacerbation and temperature variability, tick-borne infections and warming climates, and airborne pollutants and cerebrovascular disease incidence and severity. DISCUSSION: Temperature extremes and variability both associated with stroke incidence and severity, migraine headaches, hospitalization in patients with dementia, and multiple sclerosis exacerbations. Exposure to airborne pollutants, especially PM2.5 and nitrates, associated with stroke incidence and severity, headaches, dementia risk, Parkinson disease, and MS exacerbation. Climate change has demonstrably expanded favorable conditions for zoonotic diseases beyond traditional borders and poses the risk of disease in new, susceptible populations. Articles were biased toward resource-rich regions, suggesting a discordance between where research occurs and where changes are most acute. As such, 3 key priorities emerged for further study: neuroinfectious disease risk mitigation, understanding the pathophysiology of airborne pollutants on the nervous system, and methods to improve delivery of neurologic care in the face of climate-related disruptions.",

      "abstract": "This review aimed to systematically summarize the epidemiological literature on the cardiorespiratory effects of PM2.5 published during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020) in China. Original articles published between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2021 were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Internet Database and Wanfang Database. Random- or fixed-effects models were used to pool effect estimates where appropriate. Of 8558 records identified, 145 met the full eligibility criteria. A 10 µg/m³ increase in short-term PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with increases of 0.70%, 0.86%, 0.38% and 0.96% in cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and respiratory morbidity, respectively. The specific diseases with significant associations included stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia and allergic rhinitis. The pooled estimates per 10 µg/m³ increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure were 15.1%, 11.9% and 21.0% increases in cardiovascular, stroke and lung cancer mortality, and 17.4%, 11.0% and 4.88% increases in cardiovascular, hypertension and lung cancer incidence respectively. Adverse changes in blood pressure, heart rate variability, systemic inflammation, blood lipids, lung function and airway inflammation were observed for either short-term or long-term PM2.5 exposure, or both. Collectively, we summarized representative exposure-response relationships between short- and long-term PM2.5 exposure and a wide range of cardiorespiratory outcomes applicable to China. The magnitudes of estimates were generally smaller in short-term associations and comparable in long-term associations compared with those in developed countries. Our findings are helpful for future standard revisions and policy formulation. There are still some notable gaps that merit further investigation in China.",

Previous researches have indicated that air pollution is nearly related to various diseases, but few studies have focused on the exact function mediated by particulate matter less than 2.5 (PM2.5) in these diseases. PM2.5 is known to induce multiple ways of cell death, including autophagy, necrosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Therefore, it is of much importance to understand the different ways of cell death caused by PM2.5 in the pathogenesis and treatment of PM2.5-related diseases.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed that there have been mixed results in the literature regarding the association between ambient particulate matter (PM) and myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the rate of short-term exposure PM with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and examine its potential effect(s) on the risk of MI. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase with components: \"air pollution\" and \"myocardial infarction\". The summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were also calculated to assess the association between the PM2.5 and MI. RESULTS: Twenty-six published studies were ultimately identified as eligible candidates for the meta-analysis of MI until Jun 1, 2018. The results illustrated that a 10-μg/m 3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with the risk of MI (RR = 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; P ≤ 0.0001). The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed through a random-effects model with p < 0.0001 and the I2 was 69.52%, indicating a moderate degree of heterogeneity. We also conducted subgroup analyses including study quality, study design, and study period. Accordingly, it was found that subgroups time series study design and high study period could substantially decrease heterogeneity (I2 = 41.61, 41.78). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that exposure - response between PM2.5 and MI. It is vital decision makers implement effective strategies to help improve air pollution, especially in developing countries or prevent exposure to PM2.5 to protect human health.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As the largest developing country, China has some of the worst air quality in the world. Heavy smog in January 2013 led to unprecedented public concern about the health impact of exposure to particulate matter. Conducting health impact assessments of particulate matter has thus become an urgent task for public health practitioners. Combined estimates of the health effects of exposure to particulate matter from quantitative reviews could provide vital information for epidemiology-based health impact assessments, but estimates for the Chinese population are limited. METHODS: On December 31, 2013, we systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using as keywords names of 127 major cities in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. From among the 1464 articles identified, 59 studies were manually screened. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to combine their risk estimates, the funnel plots with Egger test were performed to evaluate the publication bias and Meta regression were run to explore the association between exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 and 2.5 µm (PM10 and PM2.5) and the resulting health effects by the Comprehensive Meta Analysis. RESULTS: In terms of short-term effects, the combined excess risks of total non-accidental mortality, mortality due to cardiovascular disease, and mortality due to respiratory disease were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.26%, 0.46%), 0.36% (95%CI: 0.24%, 0.49%), and 0.42% (95%CI: 0.28%, 0.55%), for each 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM10. A 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.40% (95%CI: 0.22%, 0.59%) increase in total non-accidental mortality, a 0.63% (95%CI: 0.35%, 0.91%) increase in mortality due to cardiovascular disease, and a 0.75% (95%CI: 01.39%, 1.11%) increase in mortality due to respiratory disease. For constituent-specific mortality, increases of 0.40-3.11% were associated with an increase of 10 ng/m(3) for nickel in PM. The summary estimate ranges of hospital utilization were 0.08% ~ 0.72% and -0.58% ~ 1.32% for a 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM10 and PM2.5. In terms of long-term effects, a 10 μg/m(3) increase of PM10 corresponded to 23-67% increase in the risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Short exposures to PM10 and PM2.5 are associated with increases in mortality, but evidence of constituent-associated health effects, long-term effects and morbidity in China is still inadequate.",

      "abstract": "Existing studies have explored the associations between short-term or long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and mortality and morbidity outcomes related to all-causes, natural causes and the cardiopulmonary system, but the results are still inconclusive. To explore the associations between short-term and long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 constituents with mortality and morbidity outcomes of all-cause, natural, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus electronic databases to identify studies until 28, August 2023. We estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) using random-effect models. Then we explored potential sources of heterogeneity across different studies by subgroup and meta-regression analysis. A total of 67 articles were included in the meta-analysis. We found that short-term exposures to PM2.5 carbon-containing constituents (black carbon and organic carbon) and metal iron showed the most consistent associations with the eight health outcomes among different PM2.5 constituents. Meanwhile, only long-term exposures to nitrate ions and silicon in PM2.5 showed significant positive associations with cardiovascular and natural mortality outcomes. Additionally, subgroup and meta-regression analyses highlight that geographical region and age group are primary sources of heterogeneity. The current meta-analysis reveals potential key PM2.5 constituents associated with elevated risk of mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Thus, greater attention should be directed toward establishing exposure limits for specific PM2.5 constituents to protect public health and alleviate the associated burden of diseases.",

The current review investigate epidemiological and experimental findings from 2016 to 2021, which enabled the systemic overview of PM2.5's toxic impacts on human health. The Web of Science database search used descriptive terms to investigate the interaction among PM2.5 exposure, systemic effects, and COVID-19 disease. Analyzed studies have indicated that cardiovascular and respiratory systems have been extensively investigated and indicated as the main air pollution targets. Nevertheless, PM2.5 reaches other organic systems and harms the renal, neurological, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. Pathologies onset and/or get worse due to toxicological effects associated with the exposure to this particle type, since it can trigger several reactions, such as inflammatory responses, oxidative stress generation and genotoxicity. These cellular dysfunctions lead to organ malfunctions, as shown in the current review. In addition, the correlation between COVID-19/Sars-CoV-2 and PM2.5 exposure was also assessed to help better understand the role of atmospheric pollution in the pathophysiology of this disease. Despite the significant number of studies about PM2.5's effects on organic functions, available in the literature, there are still gaps in knowledge about how this particulate matter can hinder human health. The current review aimed to approach the main findings about the effect of PM2.5 exposure on different systems, and demonstrate the likely interaction of COVID-19/Sars-CoV-2 and PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "The impact of ambient particulate matter (PM) on public health has become a great global concern, which is especially prominent in developing countries. For health purposes, PM is typically defined by size, with the smaller particles having more health impacts. Particles with a diameter <2.5 μm are called PM2.5. Initial research studies have focused on the impact of PM2.5 on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases; nevertheless, an increasing number of data suggested that PM2.5 may affect every organ system in the human body, and the kidney is of no exception. The kidney is vulnerable to particulate matter because most environmental toxins are concentrated by the kidney during filtration. According to the high morbidity and mortality related to chronic kidney disease, it is necessary to determine the effect of PM2.5 on kidney disease and its mechanism that needs to be identified. To understand the current status of PM2.5 in the atmosphere and their potential harmful kidney effects in different regions of the world this review article was prepared based on peer-reviewed scientific papers, scientific reports, and database from government organizations published after the year 1998. In this review, we focus on the worldwide epidemiological evidence linking PM2.5 with chronic kidney disease and the effect of PM2.5 on the chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. At the same time, we also discuss the possible mechanisms of PM2.5 exposure leading to kidney damage, in order to emphasize the contribution of PM2.5 to kidney damage. A global database on PM2.5 and kidney disease should be developed to provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.",

We aimed to summarize the effect of short-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) on morbidity and mortality in Latin America and evaluate evidence coverage and quality, using systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The comprehensive search (six online databases and hand-searching) identified studies investigating the short-term associations between PM2.5 and daily health events in LA. Two reviewers independently accessed the internal validity of the studies and used random-effect models in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 1628 studies. Nine were elected for the qualitative analysis and seven for the quantitative analyses. Each 10 µg/m3 increments in daily PM2.5 concentrations was significantly associated with increased risk for respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in all-ages (polled RR = 1.02, 95% CI, 1.02-1.02 and RR = 1.01, 95% CI , 1.01-1.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 in LA is significantly associated with increased risk for respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Evidence is concentrated in few cities and some presented high risk of bias.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fine particulate matter (Particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) is associated with multiple health outcomes, with varying effects across seasons and locations. It remains largely unknown that which components of PM2.5 are most harmful to human health. METHODS: We systematically searched all the relevent studies published before August 1, 2018, on the associations of fine particulate matter constituents with mortality and morbidity, using Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE. Studies were included if they explored the associations between short term or long term exposure of fine particulate matter constituents and natural, cardiovascular or respiratory health endpoints. The criteria for the risk of bias was adapted from OHAT and New Castle Ottawa. We applied a random-effects model to derive the risk estimates for each constituent. We performed main analyses restricted to studies which adjusted the PM2.5 mass in their models. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between several PM2.5 constituents and different health endpoints. Among them, black carbon and organic carbon were most robustly and consistently associated with all natural, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Other potential toxic constituents including nitrate, sulfate, Zinc, silicon, iron, nickel, vanadium, and potassium were associated with adverse cardiovascular health, while nitrate, sulfate and vanadium were relevant for adverse respiratory health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that black carbon and organic carbon are important detrimental components of PM2.5, while other constituents are probably hazardous to human health. However, more studies are needed to further confirm our results.",

      "abstract": "In China, the level of ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) pollution far exceeds the air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization. Moreover, the health effects of PM 2.5 exposure have become a major public health issue. More than half of PM 2.5 -related excess deaths are caused by cardiopulmonary disease, which has become a major health risk associated with PM 2.5 pollution. In this review, we discussed the latest epidemiological advances relating to the health effects of PM 2.5 on cardiopulmonary diseases in China, including studies relating to the effects of PM 2.5 on mortality, morbidity, and risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These data provided important evidence to highlight the cardiopulmonary risk associated with PM 2.5 across the world. In the future, further studies need to be carried out to investigate the specific relationship between the constituents and sources of PM 2.5 and cardiopulmonary disease. These studies provided scientific evidence for precise reduction measurement of pollution sources and public health risks. It is also necessary to identify effective biomarkers and elucidate the biological mechanisms and pathways involved; this may help us to take steps to reduce PM 2.5 pollution and reduce the incidence of cardiopulmonary disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with premature mortality, but associations at concentrations lower than current annual limit values are uncertain. We analysed associations between low-level air pollution and mortality within the multicentre study Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE). METHODS: In this multicentre longitudinal study, we analysed seven population-based cohorts of adults (age ≥30 years) within ELAPSE, from Belgium, Denmark, England, the Netherlands, Norway, Rome (Italy), and Switzerland (enrolled in 2000-11; follow-up until 2011-17). Mortality registries were used to extract the underlying cause of death for deceased individuals. Annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2·5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon, and tropospheric warm-season ozone (O3) from Europe-wide land use regression models at 100 m spatial resolution were assigned to baseline residential addresses. We applied cohort-specific Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for area-level and individual-level covariates to evaluate associations with non-accidental mortality, as the main outcome, and with cardiovascular, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality. Subset analyses of participants living at low pollutant concentrations (as per predefined values) and natural splines were used to investigate the concentration-response function. Cohort-specific effect estimates were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We analysed 28 153 138 participants contributing 257 859 621 person-years of observation, during which 3 593 741 deaths from non-accidental causes occurred. We found significant positive associations between non-accidental mortality and PM2·5, NO2, and black carbon, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·053 (95% CI 1·021-1·085) per 5 μg/m3 increment in PM2·5, 1·044 (1·019-1·069) per 10 μg/m3 NO2, and 1·039 (1·018-1·059) per 0·5 × 10-5/m black carbon. Associations with PM2·5, NO2, and black carbon were slightly weaker for cardiovascular mortality, similar for non-malignant respiratory mortality, and stronger for lung cancer mortality. Warm-season O3 was negatively associated with both non-accidental and cause-specific mortality. Associations were stronger at low concentrations: HRs for non-accidental mortality at concentrations lower than the WHO 2005 air quality guideline values for PM2·5 (10 μg/m3) and NO2 (40 μg/m3) were 1·078 (1·046-1·111) per 5 μg/m3 PM2·5 and 1·049 (1·024-1·075) per 10 μg/m3 NO2. Similarly, the association between black carbon and non-accidental mortality was highest at low concentrations, with a HR of 1·061 (1·032-1·092) for exposure lower than 1·5× 10-5/m, and 1·081 (0·966-1·210) for exposure lower than 1·0× 10-5/m. INTERPRETATION: Long-term exposure to concentrations of PM2·5 and NO2 lower than current annual limit values was associated with non-accidental, cardiovascular, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality in seven large European cohorts. Continuing research on the effects of low concentrations of air pollutants is expected to further inform the process of setting air quality standards in Europe and other global regions.

      "abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, pose a significant threat to both the environment and human health. In addition to destroying ecosystems, these fires cause severe air pollution, particularly through fine particulate matter (PM2.5, diameter ≤ 2.5 µm), which can be transported over long distances. A recent example are the wildfires in Canada, whose smoke enveloped New York City in dense smog. Fine particulate matter increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, especially among vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, individuals with preexisting conditions, and the elderly. Globally, emissions from wildfires are linked to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths annually. Protective measures such as early warning systems, air filtration systems, and the use of masks can help reduce exposure. However, knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the specific components of pollutants and their interactions with environmental factors. Long-term research is essential to better understand the health impacts and to develop targeted prevention strategies. Wildfires underscore the urgent need for global climate protection measures and innovative approaches to public health preparedness.",

      "abstract": "Several epidemiologic and toxicological studies have widely regarded ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), the particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm, as a strong potential threat to human health. PM2.5 exposure is mainly through the respiratory tract where it can permeate the lung alveoli and enter the blood circulation. After going into the circulation, PM2.5 directly confronts the vascular endothelial cells (VECs). The VECs, which are lined up in the innermost layer of the blood vessels, are essential in the homeostasis of physiological processes. Thus, the damage and dysfunction of VECs is a common cause of various diseases. In this review, we summarize the toxicity of PM2.5 to VECs including the pathophysiological mechanism and the effects of VEC-mediated physiological functions. The review has discussed the association of impaired VEC function by PM2.5 with various diseases, indicating that the VECs may be an effective assessment of public health recommendations under PM2.5 exposure. Therefore, reducing the adverse effect of PM2.5 on VECs will prevent the potential occurrence and fatality of the relevant diseases in the future.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) released from agriculture is contributing significantly to acidification and atmospheric NH3 may have on human health is much less readily available. The potential direct impact of NH3 on the health of the general public is under-represented in scientific literature, though there have been several studies which indicate that NH3 has a direct effect on the respiratory health of those who handle livestock. These health impacts can include a reduced lung function, irritation to the throat and eyes, and increased coughing and phlegm expulsion. More recent studies have indicated that agricultural NH3 may directly influence the early on-set of asthma in young children. In addition to the potential direct impact of ammonia, it is also a substantial contributor to the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) fraction (namely the US and Europe); where it accounts for the formation of 30% and 50% of all PM2.5 respectively. PM2.5 has the ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause long term illnesses such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Hence, PM2.5 causes economic losses which equate to billions of dollars (US) to the global economy annually. Both premature deaths associated with the health impacts from PM2.5 and economic losses could be mitigated with a reduction in NH3 emissions resulting from agriculture. As agriculture contributes to more than 81% of all global NH3 emissions, it is imperative that food production does not come at a cost to the world's ability to breathe; where reductions in NH3 emissions can be easier to achieve than other associated pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm or PM2.5 is recognized worldwide as a cause of public health problems, mainly associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There is accumulating evidence to show that exposure to PM2.5 has a crucial causative role in various neurological disorders, the main ones being dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). PM2.5 can activate glial and microglial activity, resulting in neuroinflammation, increased intracellular ROS production, and ultimately neuronal apoptosis. PM2.5 also causes the alteration of neuronal morphology and synaptic changes and increases AD biomarkers, including amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated-tau, as well as raising the levels of enzymes involved in the amyloidogenic pathway. Clinical trials have highlighted the correlation between exposure to PM2.5, dementia, and AD diagnosis. This correlation is also displayed by concordant evidence from animal models, as indicated by increased AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and markers of vascular injury. Blood-brain barrier disruption is another aggravated phenomenon demonstrated in people at risk who are exposed to PM2.5. This review summarizes and discusses studies from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on causative relationships of PM2.5 exposure to AD-related neuropathology. Conflicting data are also examined in order to determine the actual association between ambient air pollution and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is hypothesized to increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the epidemiological evidence is inconsistent. We identified 33 studies with more than 4 million MI patients and applied meta-analysis and meta-regression to assess the available evidence. Twenty-five studies presented the effects of the PM level on hospitalization for MI patients, while eight studies showed the effects on mortality. An increase in PM10 was associated with hospitalization and mortality in myocardial infarction patients (RR per 10 μg/m(3) = 1.011, 95% CI 1.006-1.016; RR per 10 μg/m(3) = 1.008, 95 % CI 1.004-1.012, respectively); PM2.5 also increased the risk of hospitalization and mortality in MI patients (RR per 10 μg/m(3) = 1.024, 95% CI 1.007-1.041 for hospitalization and RR per 10 μg/m(3) = 1.012, 95% CI 1.010-1.015 for mortality). The results of the cumulative meta-analysis indicated that PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with myocardial infarction with the addition of new studies each year. In conclusion, short-term exposure to high PM10 and PM2.5 levels revealed to increase risk of hospitalization and mortality for myocardial infarction. Policy support of pollution control and individual protection was strongly recommended.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Air pollution has steadily increased for several decades, with widely studied effects on human health, including increased mortality, incidence of stroke, respiratory and allergic disease. However, the effects of pollution on the ocular surface, in direct contact with the outside world, have been less precisely studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature review of articles on the subject published from 1966 to October 2020. Among the 661 articles identified, 33 were retained. Ocular surface disease associated with pollution included non-specific conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, and allergic conjunctivitis. The studied pollutants were particulate matter less than 2.5μm and 10μm (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Certain air quality parameters such as temperature and relative humidity were also studied. RESULTS: Among the markers of air pollution possibly associated with ophthalmic disease, NO2 and SO2 appear to be the most frequent and highly correlated. High temperatures and low humidity levels also appear to be aggravating factors for the ocular surface. However, due to the heterogeneity of the studies, the results must be interpreted with caution. Indeed, the methodology and the results of the various studies are sometimes contradictory. The inclusion of patients, the analysis of environmental data, and the correlation between these two elements indeed raise numerous methodological questions. CONCLUSION: Air pollution control would appear essential, as well as the development of new studies based on reliable methods of studying the environmental and its clinical effects.",

Meanwhile, environment air pollution has become a serious health risk factor, contributing to the mortality of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. A substantial body of evidence has shown that many types of vascular diseases are related to air pollution. The physiology and pathophysiology of the three layers of vascular vessels, especially the inner and medial layer, contribute to the process of vascular diseases. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the predominant cells in the medial layer, and several studies have indicated that air pollution has an adverse effect on VSMCs. There are numerous sources of air pollution across the world, and the components of air pollutants are a complex mixture of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter. Among these air pollutants, particulate matter (PM)2.5 presents the highest risk factor leading to global mortality from cardiovascular disease and disability. In this review, we primarily focus on the impacts of PM2.5 exposure on VSMCs. We further discuss the correlation between exposure to PM2.5 and other vascular diseases and present potential protective and treatment strategies to decrease vascular mortality related to air pollution.",

Examining the composition and characteristics of PM2.5, such as particle size and surface area, reveals its ability to induce inflammatory injury and oxidative damage. The carcinogenic potential extends beyond respiratory implications, affecting various organs, including the digestive tract, breast, and prostate. In addition to the genotoxic effects of PM2.5, attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are recognized to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals with specific implications for breast and prostate cancer. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased cancer mortality, with specific risks identified for different cancer types. The linear correlation between cancer risk and PM2.5 concentration calls for a re-evaluation of permissible emission levels. The article concludes by proposing specific mitigating strategies for individuals exposed to elevated PM2.5. It suggests antioxidant-rich diets and supplements, and exploring inhalation-based antioxidant administration as potential protective measures.",

PM2.5 is able to penetrate both respiratory and placental barriers, thereby resulting in negative effects on fetal development. A large body of epidemiological evidences has suggested that gestational exposure to PM2.5 increases the incidence of congenital diseases in offspring, including congenital heart defects. In addition, animal model studies have revealed that gestational exposure to PM2.5 can disrupt normal heart development in offspring, although the potential molecular mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated.

Air pollutants, including particulate matter < or = 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particulate matter < or = 10 microns (PM10), ozone (O3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), and traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), have demonstrated the negative effects on human health (e.g., increased cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, malignancy, and mortality). Organ transplant patients, who are taking immunosuppressive agents, are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollutants. The evidence from clinical investigation has shown that exposure to air pollution after organ transplantation is associated with organ rejection, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, infection-related mortality, and vitamin D deficiency. OBJECTIVES AND METHOD: This review aims to summarize and discuss the association of exposure to air pollutants and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and outcomes after transplantation. Controversial findings are also included and discussed.

      "abstract": "Exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been linked to increased mortality in several epidemiological studies but the question remains of whether NO2 is directly responsible for the health effects or is only an indicator of other pollutants, including particulate matter. The aim of the present review was to provide pooled estimates of the long-term effects of NO2 on mortality, which are potentially useful for health impact assessment. We selected 23 papers, published from 2004 to 2013, evaluating the relationship between NO2 and mortality, also including an assessment of the effect of particulate matter exposure. A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out on 19 studies. The pooled effect on mortality was 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.06) with an increase of 10 μg · m(-3) in the annual NO2 concentration and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) for particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) (10 μg · m(-3)). The effect on cardiovascular mortality was 1.13 (95% CI 1.09-1.18) for NO2 and 1.20 (95% CI 1.09-1.31) for PM2.5. The NO2 effect on respiratory mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 1.02-1.03) and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) for PM2.5. Four bipollutant analyses with particulate matter and NO2 in the same models showed minimal changes in the effect estimates of NO2. There is evidence of a long-term effect of NO2 on mortality as great as that of PM2.5. An independent effect of NO2 emerged from multipollutant models.",

The major contributor to air pollution is particulate matter ≤2.5 µg per cubic meter of air (PM2.5) from vehicles, industrial emissions, and wildfire smoke. United States ambient air standards recommend annual average PM2.5 concentrations of ≤12 μg/m³ while European standards allow an average annual PM2.5 concentration of ≤20 μg/m3. However, significant PM2.5 cardiovascular and pulmonary health risks exist below these concentrations. Chronic PM2.5 exposure significantly increases major cardiovascular and pulmonary event risks in Americans by 8 to more than 20% for each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5. PM2.5-induced increases in lipid peroxidation, induction of vascular inflammation and endothelial cell injury initiate and propagate respiratory diseases, coronary and carotid atherosclerosis. PM2.5 can cause atherosclerotic vascular plaque rupture and myocardial infarction and stroke by activating metalloproteinases.

In this viewpoint, we identify present gaps in air pollution monitoring and regulation, and how they could be strengthened in future mitigation policies to more optimally reduce health impacts. We conclude that there is a need to move beyond simply regulating PM2.5 particulate matter mass concentrations at central site stations. A greater emphasis is needed on: new portable and affordable technologies to measure personal exposures to particle mass; the consideration of a submicron (PM1) mass air quality standard; and further evaluations of effects by particle composition and source. We emphasize the need to enable further studies on exposure-health relationships in underserved populations that are disproportionately impacted by air pollution, but not sufficiently represented in current studies.",

      "abstract": "Traffic is one of the major contributors to PM2.5 in cities worldwide. Quantifying the role of traffic is an important step towards understanding the impact of transport policies on the possibilities to achieve cleaner air and accompanying health benefits. With the aim of estimating potential health benefits of eliminating traffic emissions, we carried out a meta-analysis using the World Health Organisation (WHO) database of source apportionment studies of PM2.5 concentrations. Specifically, we used a Bayesian meta-regression approach, modelling both overall and traffic-related (tailpipe and non-tailpipe) concentrations simultaneously. We obtained the distributions of expected PM2.5 concentrations (posterior densities) of different types for 117 cities worldwide. Using the non-linear Integrated Exposure Response (IER) function of PM2.5, we estimated percent reduction in different disease endpoints for a scenario with complete removal of traffic emissions. We found that eliminating traffic emissions results in achieving the WHO-recommended concentration of PM2.5 only for a handful of cities that already have low concentrations of pollution. The percentage reduction in premature mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases increases up to a point (30-40 ug/m3), and above this concentration, it flattens off. For diabetes-related mortality, the percentage reduction in mortality decreases with increasing concentrations-a trend that is opposite to other outcomes. For cities with high concentrations of pollution, the results highlight the need for multi-sectoral strategies to reduce pollution. The IER functions of PM2.5 result in diminishing returns of health benefits at high concentrations, and in case of diabetes, there are even negative returns. The results show the significant effect of the shape of IER functions on health benefits. Overall, despite the diminishing results, a significant burden of deaths can be prevented by policies that aim to reduce traffic emissions even at high concentrations of pollution.",

      "abstract": "Studies on adverse health effects associated with air pollution mostly focus on individual pollutants. However, the air is a complex medium, and thus epidemiological studies face many challenges and limitations in the multipollutant approach. NO2 and PM2.5 have been selected as both originating from combustion processes and are considered to be the main pollutants associated with traffic; moreover, both elicit oxidative stress responses. An answer to the question of whether synergistic or antagonistic health effects of combined pollutants are demonstrated by pollutants monitored in ambient air is not explicit. Among the analyzed studies, only a few revealed statistical significance. Exposure to a single pollutant (PM2.5 or NO2) was mostly associated with a small increase in non-accidental mortality (HR:1.01-1.03). PM2.5 increase of <10 µg/m3 adjusted for NO2 as well as NO2 adjusted for PM2.5 resulted in a slightly lower health risk than a single pollutant. In the case of cardiovascular heart disease, mortality evoked by exposure to PM2.5 or NO2 adjusted for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively, revealed an antagonistic effect on health risk compared to the single pollutant. Both short- and long-term exposure to PM2.5 or NO2 adjusted for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively, revealed a synergistic effect appearing as higher mortality from respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Clinical Background: As a result of modern industrialization, air pollution has become a potential contributor to global burden of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and kidney disease. Epidemiology: Emerging epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with an increased risk for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD-related mortality. Exposure to PM2.5, even at relatively low concentrations, is a risk factor for a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and a faster decline in glomerular filtration rate. It has been estimated that the global burden of CKD attributable to PM2.5 is 6.95 million incident cases of CKD per year. Low- and middle-income countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions experienced the highest urban air pollution levels, thus facing a heavier burden of related disease. Challenges: Despite a growing awareness of kidney damage related to air pollution, large gaps still exist between the exact toxicological effect of particles on the kidney and the increasing prevalence of air pollution-related kidney diseases. Considering the geographic variation of air pollution, more longitudinal studies in different parts of the world are urgently needed, especially in those most affected countries. Prevention and Treatment: Air pollution control should be regarded as a high priority in urban plan and policy making. Actions are required to narrow gaps in knowledge and clean air, thus preventing air pollution-related kidney disease.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders can lead to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, but the cause of these conditions is not well understood. We have systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating the association between exposure to ambient air pollution and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. We searched electronic databases for English language studies reporting associations between ambient air pollution and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders published between December 2009 and December 2013. Combined risk estimates were calculated using random-effect models for each exposure that had been examined in ≥4 studies. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated. A total of 17 articles evaluating the impact of nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOX), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), proximity to major roads, and traffic density met our inclusion criteria. Most studies reported that air pollution increased risk for pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. There was significant heterogeneity in meta-analysis, which included 16 studies reporting on gestational hypertension and preeclampsia as separate or combined outcomes; there was less heterogeneity in findings of the 10 studies reporting solely on preeclampsia. Meta-analyses showed increased risks of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy for all pollutants except CO. Random-effect meta-analysis combined odds ratio associated with a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.96) for combined pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders and 1.31 (95%confidence interval, 1.14-1.50) for preeclampsia [corrected]. Our results suggest that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Ambient air pollution (AAP) and particulate matters (PM) have been closely associated with adverse health effects such as respiratory disease and cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have examined the adverse health effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to AAP and outdoor PM on respiratory disease. However, the effect of PM size (PM2.5 and PM10) on cardiovascular disease has not been well studied. Thus, it remains unclear how the size of the inhalable particles (coarse, fine, or ultrafine) affects mortality and morbidity. Airborne PM concentrations are commonly used for ambient air quality management worldwide, owing to the known effects on cardiorespiratory health. In this article, we assess the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and PM, with a particular focus on PM size. We discuss the association of PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and elemental carbon with mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and altered blood pressure, based on epidemiological studies. In addition, we provide evidence that the adverse health effects of AAP and PM are more pronounced among the elderly, children, and people with preexisting cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Finally, we critically summarize the literature pertaining to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and stroke, and introduce potential studies to better understand the health significance of AAP and PM on cardiovascular disease.",

METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed/Web of Science databases using comprehensive search terms, then screened using predefined criteria. For studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses, we applied a systematic rubric for evaluating study quality across domains: participant selection, outcome, exposure, confounding, analysis, selective reporting, sensitivity, overall quality. When ≥3 eligible studies provided effect estimates, we performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for air pollutants and infant mortality. RESULTS: Of the 701 initial studies, we excluded 678 studies in the abstract screening and full text screening phases, leaving 23 studies for inclusion. Four studies included extractable effect estimates for PM10 and seven for PM2.5. We could not conduct meta-analyses for CO, O3, NO2, or SO2 because each had <3 eligible studies. The pooled OR (95% CI) for a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration was 1.04 (1.02, 1.06) for all-cause, 1.11 (1.02, 1.21) for respiratory, and 1.05 (0.98, 1.13) for SIDS infant mortality. The pooled OR for a 5-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was 1.02 (0.98, 1.05) for all-cause, 0.83 (0.30, 2.27) for respiratory, and 0.97 (0.88, 1.08) for SIDS infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to PM10 is associated with all-cause and respiratory infant mortality across studies.",

Our goal was to assess the current literature to characterize the association between PM2.5 and adverse health at low exposure levels. RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed 26 papers that examined the association between short- and long-term exposure to PM2.5 and cardio-respiratory morbidity and mortality. There is evidence suggesting that these associations are stronger at lower levels. However, there are certain methodological and interpretational limitations specific to studies of low PM2.5 levels, and further methodological development is warranted. There is strong agreement across studies that air pollution effects on adverse health are still observable at low concentrations, even well below current US standards. These findings suggest that US standards need to be reevaluated, given that further improving air quality has the potential of benefiting public health.",

Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone) and arrhythmia hospitalization or arrhythmia mortality. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were analyzed via a random-effects model and reported as relative risk and 95% confidence interval. 25 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria and 23 contributed to the meta-analysis. Arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality were associated with increases in PM2.5 (RR = 1.015 per 10 μg/m³, 95% CI: 1.006-1.024), PM10 (RR = 1.009 per 10 μg/m³, 95% CI: 1.004-1.014), carbon monoxide (RR = 1.041 per 1 ppm, 95% CI: 1.017-1.065), nitrogen dioxide (RR = 1.036 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.020-1.053), and sulfur dioxide (RR = 1.021 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.003-1.039), but not ozone (RR = 1.012 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 0.997-1.027). Both particulate and gaseous components, with the exception of ozone, have a temporal association with arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLWH) are more vulnerable to infectious and non-infectious comorbidities due to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction. Air pollution is a major global health risk, contributing to millions of deaths annually, primarily from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, the link between air pollution and mortality risk in PLWH is underexplored. This systematic review assesses the association between exposure to pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) and mortality risk in PLWH. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted for studies published up to August 2024. Eligibility criteria included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies assessing air pollution exposure and mortality in PLWH. Nested-Knowledge software was used for screening and data extraction. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was applied for quality assessment. A narrative approach and tabular summarization were used for data synthesis and presentation. RESULTS: Nine studies, mostly from China, demonstrated a significant association between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 and increased risks of AIDS-related and all-cause mortality in PLWH. Hazard ratios for mortality increased by 2.38-5.13% per unit increase in PM concentrations, with older adults (> 60), females, and those with lower CD4 counts (< 500 cells/µL) being more vulnerable. Short-term exposure to ozone and sulfur dioxide also increased mortality risks, particularly during the warm season and in older populations. Specific pollutants like ammonium (NH4⁺) and sulfate (SO4²⁻) had the strongest links to elevated mortality. CONCLUSION: Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter and ozone, is associated with a higher risk of mortality in PLWH. Targeted interventions to reduce pollution exposure in vulnerable subgroups are crucial. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in diverse regions and develop effective mitigation strategies.",

Generalized additive models combined with polynomial distributed lag models were applied to explore the associations between UFP level and pediatric EDVs for respiratory diseases. We fitted two-pollutant models with criteria air pollutants and performed stratified analyses by gender and age. RESULTS: UFP was associated with increased EDVs for all respiratory diseases in cumulative lags up to 2 d and 3 d. The greatest risk was found at cumulative lags (0-2 d) for all respiratory diseases. At cumulative lags (0-2 d), an interquartile range increase in concentrations of UFP (1800 particles/cm3) was associated with relative risks of EDVs due to asthma [1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.59], pneumonia (1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.38), bronchitis (1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.33) and URTI (1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.28). These associations were almost unchanged when controlling for criteria air pollutants, and there was no threshold below which the associations were not present. There were stronger associations in children aged 0-13 years. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to UFP may independently increase the risks of EDVs for asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis and URTI exacerbations among children.",

This research explores the relationship between Asia dust storm (ADS) and tracheitis hospital admissions, by using a Poisson time-series model on the 2000-2012 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRB) from Taiwan and linking air pollutants and temperature data. From a total of 126,013 tracheitis hospital admissions, the average number of daily tracheitis hospital admissions is 26.53 and increases 10% notably one day after ADS. The empirical result shows that ADS does significantly affect tracheitis hospital admissions 3 and 5 days after an event for the overall sample and 2-4 days after it for females. For the age group <45, the number significantly increases 3-4 days after ADS, revealing that ADS has a prolonged effect on tracheitis hospital admissions.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution has been shown to increase frequency of asthma attacks, as usually measured by hospitalisation rates. We hypothesise that purchase of asthma reliever medications will reflect a broader association between the environmental exposure and asthma exacerbations. In a time series analysis, we estimated the association of dust storms with mild asthma manifestations, as indicated by medication purchases, during 2005-2011. We compared our results with the estimation of the association of dust storms with hospitalisations due to asthma and asthma-like symptoms. We detected 289 dust storms characterised by high levels of particulate matter <10 μm in diameter. We identified 42,920 children with asthma, wheezing or asthma-like symptoms, of whom 2418 were hospitalised. We observed a higher risk of asthma medication purchase on the day of a mild dust storm (relative risk 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10). The next peak in drug purchases was 3 days later and was more pronounced among Bedouin-Arab children. Stratified analyses showed higher risks for hospitalisation among Bedouin-Arab children; especially among children living in temporary houses (relative risk 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.71). We observed an increased risk of asthma medication purchase associated with mild dust storms. The risk observed for hospitalisation was more pronounced among the rural Bedouin-Arab population.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To refine and revise previous air pollution, climate and health time series analysis in Christchurch, New Zealand, introducing viral identification data (positive identification count and outbreak, defined as two of more positive tests). METHOD: The effects on daily respiratory admissions for five years (1998-2002) of air pollution (PM(10) ), climate and virology (incorporating actual counts and outbreaks of influenza A and B (INF), para influenza virus type 3 (PIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were examined using generalised additive models (GAMs), which are one of semiparametric models. Results were also compared with a model that included climate and air pollution parameters but without the inclusion of virology data. The data were analysed aggregately and then stratified by age group and season. RESULTS: Different virology data detected various association levels. The highest estimates were a 3.93% (CI: 2.69-5.17) and a 3.88% (CI: 2.65-5.12) rise in respiratory admissions for a rise of 10 µg/m(3) annual PM(10) with outbreak and actual counts of PIV respectively for 0-19 years old with a three-day lag. CONCLUSION: Refining a statistical model with the addition of virology data gives a similar estimation of the association between PM(10) levels and respiratory admissions to previous research. Use of the indicator of an outbreak of viral infection appears to be similar to actual count of viruses detected.",

      "abstract": "The effects of air pollution on health have been studied worldwide. Given that air pollution triggers oxidative stress and inflammation, it is plausible that high levels of air pollutants cause higher number of hospitalisations. This study aimed to assess the impact of air pollution on the emergency hospitalisation for respiratory disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study was divided in two parts: Part I specifically addressing the air pollution assessment and Part II addressing the health assessment. Accordingly, this Part II aimed to estimate the association between the concentrations of PM₁₀, SO₂ and CO observed in Rio de Janeiro and the number of emergency hospitalisations at a central hospital due to respiratory diseases. The pollutant concentrations were measured at two different sites in Rio de Janeiro, but the excess relative risks were calculated based on the concentrations observed at one of the sites, where limits were generally exceeded more frequently, between September 2000 and December 2005. A time series analysis was performed using the number of hospitalisations, divided in three categories (children until 1 year old, children aged between 1 and 5 years old and elderly with 65 years old or more) as independent variable, the concentrations of pollutants as dependent variables and temperature, relative humidity, long term trend, and seasonality as confounders. Data were analysed using generalised additive models with smoothing for some of the dependent variables. Results showed an excess risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disease higher than 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in PM₁₀ concentrations for children under 5 years old, of 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in SO₂ for elderly above 65 years old and around 0.1% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in CO for children under 1 year and elderly. Other studies have found associations that are in agreement with the results achieved in this study. The study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants experienced in Rio de Janeiro between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the number of hospitalisations for respiratory diseases among children and elderly.",

A Poisson regression model was used to determine the statistical relationship between acute paediatric asthma A and E visits and Saharan dust cover with and without other variables such as climatic parameters and month. During the study period, there were 2,655 A and E visits for acute asthma. There was an association between increased paediatric asthma admissions and increased Saharan dust cover. The best fitting model estimated that in one month, such as June, a deterioration of visibility due to increased Saharan dust cover from no dust (visibility =16 km) to very dusty (visibility =7 km) would increase a daily admission rate of 7.8 patients to 9.25 when climate variables such as barometric pressure and humidity were kept constant.",

A Poisson regression-type quasi-Fourier generalized linear model was built. We constructed an extended family of models to study the contribution of each variable. Daily observations of children's admissions for asthma were conducted during 2 y in hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Pollutant data (i.e., fine particles, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone) and meterological data (i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures, mean humidity, and mean barometric pressure) were collected. The result of the final model accounted for 57% of the variance in admissions. The contribution of pollution, with all periodic patterns estimated by Poisson ANOVA, was 14%, even though no pollutant alone made a significant contribution to explained variance. Autocorrelation analysis of residuals showed that the model accounted reasonably well for autocorrelation effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ambient air pollution, as many publications indicate, may have associations with skin condition. The aim of this study has been to examine such common relations for cellulitis and pharyngitis. The hypothesis is that ambient ground-level ozone may help bacteria to penetrate skin or throat. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the emergency department (ED) visits data in Edmonton, Canada for the period from 1992 (April) to 2002 (March). We retrieved all the diagnosed ED visits for cellulitis and pharyngitis. Case-crossover design was used to study potential association between ozone and those visits. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The results are reported for the interquartile range (IQR = 17.9 ppb) for 8 h maximum ozone. Positive and statistical significant results were obtained as follows: for lags from 0 to 3 (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12, lag 2); for lags from 0 to 6 days (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12, lag 3); for lags from 0 to 4 (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.09, for lag 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the response to exposure to ambient ground-level ozone for skin and pharyngitis considered separately and jointly.",

We gathered data on UFP from five European cities within 2001-2011 to investigate associations between short-term changes in concentrations and respiratory hospitalisations.We applied city-specific Poisson regression models and combined city-specific estimates to obtain pooled estimates. We evaluated the sensitivity of our findings to co-pollutant adjustment and investigated effect modification patterns by period of the year, age at admission and specific diagnoses.Our results for the whole time period do not support an association between UFP and respiratory hospitalisations, although we found suggestive associations among those 0-14 years old. We nevertheless report consistent adverse effect estimates during the warm period of the year, statistically significant after lag 2 when an increase by 10 000 particles per cm(3) was associated with a 4.27% (95% CI 1.68-6.92%) increase in hospitalisations. These effect estimates were robust to particles' mass or gaseous pollutants adjustment.Considering that our findings during the warm period may reflect better exposure assessment and that the main source of non-soluble UFP in urban areas is traffic, our results call for improved regulation of traffic emissions.",

      "abstract": "Most existing studies have investigated short-term associations between ozone exposure and acute disease events among children at a daily timescale, which might neglect risk effects happening within several hours after ozone exposure. In this research, we aimed to depict intraday associations between pediatric emergency department visits (PEDVs) and exposure to ozone in order to better detect ultra-short-term effects of ozone exposure on children. We obtained hourly data of all-cause PEDVs, air pollutants, and meteorological factors in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, China, 2015-2018. We applied time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios per 10-μg/m3 rise of ozone concentrations at various exposure periods (e.g., 0-3, 4-6, 7-12, 13-24, 25-48, and 49-72 h) prior to PEDVs, controlling for hourly relative humidity and temperature. Subgroup analyses divided by gender, age, and season were undertaken to identify the potential susceptible population and period. A total of 358,285 cases of PEDVs were included in two cities, and hourly average concentration of ozone was 45.5 μg/m3 in Guangzhou and 58.9 μg/m3 in Shenzhen, respectively. Increased risks of PEDVs occurred within a few hours (0-3 h) after exposure to ozone and remained up to 48 h. Population risks for PEDVs increased by 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.0) in Shenzhen and 0.7% (0.5 to 0.9) in Guangzhou for a 10-μg/m3 increase in ozone concentrations at lag 4-6 h and lag 7-12 h, respectively. These findings were robust to co-exposure adjustments in our sensitivity analyses. Significantly greater ozone-associated risks were consistently observed during cold months (October to March of the following year) in both cities, while we did not identify evidence for effect modification of children's age and gender. This study provided novel evidence for increased risks of acute disease events among children within several hours after ozone exposure, highlighting the significant implications for policymakers to establish hourly air quality standards for better protecting children's health.",

      "abstract": "Quantifying associations between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and health outcomes is an important public health priority. Many studies have investigated the association considering delayed effects within the past few days. Adaptive cumulative exposure distributed lag non-linear models (ACE-DLNMs) quantify associations between health outcomes and cumulative exposure that is specified in a data-adaptive way. While the ACE-DLNM framework is highly interpretable, it is limited to continuous outcomes and does not scale well to large datasets. Motivated by a large analysis of daily pollution and respiratory hospitalization counts in Canada between 2001 and 2018, we propose a generalized ACE-DLNM incorporating penalized splines, improving upon existing ACE-DLNM methods to accommodate general response types. We then develop a computationally efficient estimation strategy based on profile likelihood and Laplace approximate marginal likelihood with Newton-type methods. We demonstrate the performance and practical advantages of the proposed method through simulations. In application to the motivating analysis, the proposed method yields more stable inferences compared to generalized additive models with fixed exposures, while retaining interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Ambient air pollution poses a significant risk for a group of common and often debilitating respiratory diseases, but its direct impact on cause-specific respiratory diseases using emergency room visit (ERV) as an indicator remains to be fully explored. In this study, we conducted a time-series study of ambient PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and their association with ERV for asthma, COPD and pneumonia in a four-year time span. Relative risks for ERV as per log increase in the level of ambient pollutants with time lags of up to 10 days were calculated, using a generalized additive model of Poisson regression. Daily 24-h average concentrations of PM2.5 and pollutant gases were obtained from a local Gutting air quality monitoring station. Results showed that the ERVs for pneumonia and asthma were associated with the level of PM2.5. The effects of PM2.5 on the risk of ERV for asthma were found to be significant at lag days 1 and 2 with increasing risk of 4.34% [RR: 1.091; CI: 1.020-1.166 (95%)] and 3.58% [RR: 1.074; CI: 1.007-1.146 (95%)], respectively. The ERV for pneumonia was associated with the level of PM2.5 at lag days 5, 6 and 7, with increasing risk of 1.92% [RR: 1.039; CI: 1.009-1.070 (95%)], 2.03% [RR: 1.041; CI: 1.009-1.075 (95%)], and 1.82% [RR: 1.037; CI: 1.001-1.075 (95%)], respectively. Further, PM2.5, but not NO2 and SO2, posed a significant risk of ERV for asthma during spring at lag days 0, 1 and 2 (17.12%, RR: 1.408, CI: 1.075-1.238; 15.30%, RR: 1.358 CI: 1.158-1.166; 11.94%, RR: 1.165, CI: 1.004-1.121), which was particularly evident for those who were younger than 75 years of age. In contrast, only PM2.5 was a significant risk of ERV for COPD, which was primarily for those who were younger than 75 years of age during summer season at lag days 3, 4 and 5. (26.66%, RR: 1.704, CI: 1.104-2.632; 26.99%; RR: 1.716, CI: 1.151-2.557; 24.09%; RR: 1.619, CI: 1.111-2.360). Collectively, these results suggested significant seasonal variation and differential time lag effects of PM2.5 on ERV for asthma, COPD and pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "This study explored the effects of PM2.5 on hospital admissions (HAs) for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in southwestern Taiwan. Data on HAs for AECOPD, pollutants, and meteorological variables were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database and Environmental Protection Administration. The relative risks (RRs) of HAs for AECOPD was estimated using the Quasi-Poisson generalized additive model. A total of 38,715 HAs for AECOPD were recorded. The average daily HAs for AECOPD and mean 24-h average level of PM2.5 were 15.2 and 38.8 µg/m3, respectively. For both single and multiple pollutant (adjusted for O3 and NO2) models, increased AECOPD admissions were significantly associated with PM2.5 during cold season, with the RRs for every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 being 1.02 (95% CI = 1.007-1.040) at lag 0-1 in single-pollutant, and 1.02 (95 % CI = 1.001-1.042) at lag 0 day in multiple pollutant model. People 65 years of age and older had higher risk of HAs for AECOPD after PM2.5 exposure. The RRs of PM2.5 on HAs for AECOPD were robust after adjusting for O3 and NO2. Findings reveal an association between PM2.5 and HAs for AECOPD in southwestern Taiwan, particularly during cold season.",

      "abstract": "Many areas of the United States have air pollution levels typically below Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory limits. Most health effects studies of air pollution use meteorological (e.g., warm/cool) or astronomical (e.g., solstice/equinox) definitions of seasons despite evidence suggesting temporally-misaligned intra-annual periods of relative asthma burden (i.e., \"asthma seasons\"). We introduce asthma seasons to elucidate whether air pollutants are associated with seasonal differences in asthma emergency department (ED) visits in a low air pollution environment. Within a Bayesian time-stratified case-crossover framework, we quantify seasonal associations between highly resolved estimates of six criteria air pollutants, two weather variables, and asthma ED visits among 66,092 children ages 5-19 living in South Carolina (SC) census tracts from 2005 to 2014. Results show that coarse particulates (particulate matter <10 μm and >2.5 μm: PM10-2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) may contribute to asthma ED visits across years, but are particularly implicated in the highest-burden fall asthma season. Fine particulate matter (<2.5 μm: PM2.5) is only associated in the lowest-burden summer asthma season. Relatively cool and dry conditions in the summer asthma season and increased temperatures in the spring and fall asthma seasons are associated with increased ED visit odds. Few significant associations in the medium-burden winter and medium-high-burden spring asthma seasons suggest other ED visit drivers (e.g., viral infections) for each, respectively. Across rural and urban areas characterized by generally low air pollution levels, there are acute health effects associated with particulate matter, but only in the summer and fall asthma seasons and differing by PM size.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lanzhou is the largest heavy industrial city in northwest China and it is a typical geographical valley-like city. However, there are few studies on the relationship between air pollutants and COPD, and their respective sample sizes are small, resulting in inconsistent results. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of air pollutants on COPD hospitalizations in Lanzhou, China. METHODS: An ecological time series study with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used for analysis. Daily COPD hospitalization data in Lanzhou from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2019 were collected from 25 hospitals, as well as air pollutant data and meteorological data. RESULTS: A total of 18,275 COPD hospitalizations were enrolled. For 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and 1 mg/m3 increase in CO at lag 07 day, the RR95%CI of COPD hospitalizations were 1.048 (1.030, 1.067), 1.008 (1.004, 1.013), 1.091 (1.048, 1.135), 1.043 (1.018, 1.068), and 1.160 (1.084, 1.242), respectively. The exposure-response curves between air pollutants (except O3-8h) and COPD hospitalizations were approximately linear with no thresholds. Female, and the harmful effect of PM on aged <65 years, the effect of gaseous pollutant on those aged ≥65 years, were stronger, particularly in the cold season. Exposure to air pollutants (except O3-8h) might increase the risk of COPD hospitalizations. O3-8h has a weak and unstable effect on COPD. CONCLUSION: Exposure to air pollutants (except O3-8h) increases the risk of COPD hospitalizations. O3-8h has a weak and unstable effect on COPD hospital admissions. The harmful effect of gaseous pollutants (except O3-8h) on COPD-hospitalized patients was stronger than that of PM.",

Results from the new national monitoring network for PM2.5 make possible systematic research on health risks at national and regional scales. OBJECTIVES: To estimate risks of cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5 for Medicare enrollees and to explore heterogeneity of the variation of risks across regions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national database comprising daily time-series data daily for 1999 through 2002 on hospital admission rates (constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files) for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and injuries, ambient PM2.5 levels, and temperature and dew-point temperature for 204 US urban counties (population >200,000) with 11.5 million Medicare enrollees (aged >65 years) living an average of 5.9 miles from a PM2.5 monitor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily counts of county-wide hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of cerebrovascular, peripheral, and ischemic heart diseases, heart rhythm, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory infection, and injuries as a control outcome. RESULTS: There was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2.5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries. The largest association was for heart failure, which had a 1.28% (95% confidence interval, 0.78%-1.78%) increase in risk per 10-microg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5. Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States, which included the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, and the South. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.",

      "title": "Associations between Source-Specific Fine Particulate Matter and Emergency Department Visits for Respiratory Disease in Four U.S. Cities.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Determining which sources of PM2.5 are most toxic can help guide targeted reduction of PM2.5. However, conducting multicity epidemiologic studies of sources is difficult because source-specific PM2.5 is not directly measured, and source chemical compositions can vary between cities. OBJECTIVES: We determined how the chemical composition of primary ambient PM2.5 sources varies across cities. We estimated associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease emergency department (ED) visits and examined between-city heterogeneity in estimated associations. METHODS: We used source apportionment to estimate daily concentrations of primary source-specific PM2.5 for four U.S. cities. For sources with similar chemical compositions between cities, we applied Poisson time-series regression models to estimate associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease ED visits. RESULTS: We found that PM2.5 from biomass burning, diesel vehicle, gasoline vehicle, and dust sources was similar in chemical composition between cities, but PM2.5 from coal combustion and metal sources varied across cities. We found some evidence of positive associations of respiratory disease ED visits with biomass burning PM2.5; associations with diesel and gasoline PM2.5 were frequently imprecise or consistent with the null. We found little evidence of associations with dust PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced an approach for comparing the chemical compositions of PM2.5 sources across cities and conducted one of the first multicity studies of source-specific PM2.5 and ED visits. Across four U.S. cities, among the primary PM2.5 sources assessed, biomass burning PM2.5 was most strongly associated with respiratory health.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Estimating the health effects of ambient air pollutant mixtures is necessary to understand the risk of real-life air pollution exposures. METHODS: Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visit records for asthma or wheeze (n = 148,256), bronchitis (n = 84,597), pneumonia (n = 90,063), otitis media (n = 422,268) and upper respiratory tract infection (URI) (n = 744,942) were obtained from Georgia hospitals during 2002-2008. Spatially-contiguous daily concentrations of 11 ambient air pollutants were estimated from CMAQ model simulations that were fused with ground-based measurements. Using a case-crossover study design, odds ratios for 3-day moving average air pollutant concentrations were estimated using conditional logistic regression, matching on ZIP code, day-of-week, month, and year. RESULTS: In multipollutant models, the association of highest magnitude observed for the asthma/wheeze outcome was with \"oxidant gases\" (O3, NO2, and SO2); the joint effect estimate for an IQR increase of this mixture was OR: 1.068 (95% CI: 1.040, 1.097). The group of \"secondary pollutants\" (O3 and the PM2.5 components SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) was strongly associated with bronchitis (OR: 1.090, 95% CI: 1.050, 1.132), pneumonia (OR: 1.085, 95% CI: 1.047, 1.125), and otitis media (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.042, 1.077). ED visits for URI were strongly associated with \"oxidant gases,\" \"secondary pollutants,\" and the \"criteria pollutants\" (O3, NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposures to air pollution mixtures were associated with ED visits for several different pediatric respiratory diseases.",

      "title": "Association of hospital admission for bronchiectasis with air pollution: A province-wide time-series study in southern China.",
      "abstract": "The relation of acute fluctuations of air pollution to hospital admission for bronchiectasis remained uncertain, and large-scale studies were needed. We collected daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and daily hospitalizations for bronchiectasis for 21 cities across Guangdong Province from 2013 through 2017. We examined their association using two-stage time-series analysis. Our analysis was stratified by specific sub-diagnosis, sex and age group to assess potential effect modifications. Relative risks of hospitalization for bronchiectasis were 1.060 (95%CI 1.014-1.108) for PM10 at lag0-6, 1.067 (95%CI 1.020-1.116) for PM2.5 at lag0-6, 1.038 (95%CI 1.005-1.073) for PMcoarse at lag0-6, 1.058 (95%CI 1.015-1.103) for SO2 at lag0-4, 1.057 (95%CI 1.030-1.084) for NO2 at lag0 and 1.055 (95%CI 1.025-1.085) for CO at lag0-6 per interquartile range increase of air pollution. Specifically, acute fluctuations of air pollution might be a risk factor for bronchiectasis patients with lower respiratory infection but not with hemoptysis. Patients aged ≥65 years, and female patients appeared to be particularly susceptible to air pollution. Acute fluctuations of air pollution, particularly PM may increase the risk of hospital admission for bronchiectasis exacerbations, especially for the patients complicated with lower respiratory infection. This study strengthens the importance of reducing adverse impact on respiratory health of air pollution to protect vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "Many studies have proven the relationship between air pollutants and respiratory diseases, but few studies have assessed the impacts of air particulate matter exposure on older patients with pneumonia. This study aimed to reveal the impacts of short-term exposure to air particulate matter on the daily number of older adult patients hospitalized due to pneumonia and calculate the economic costs attributable to this exposure. We collected inpatient data from 9 city hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, and calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using a time-stratified case-crossover study design and an attributable risk model to calculate the economic burden due to particulate matter pollution. It was found that for every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, the daily number of older adult pneumonia inpatients increased by 1.5% (95% CI: 1.010-1.021) and 1.0% (95% CI: 1.006-1.014), respectively. Those 65 ~ 79 years old were more susceptible to air particulate pollutants (P < 0.05). During the study period, the total hospitalization costs and out-of-pocket expenses attributable to PM2.5 and PM10 exposure were 44.60 million CNY (6.22%) and 16.03 million CNY (6.21%), respectively, with PM2.5 being the primary influencing factor. This study revealed the relationship between particulate matter pollution and pneumonia among older adults. The role of policies to limit particulate matter concentrations in reducing disease burden among older adults can be further explored.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma affects millions of people worldwide. Lima, Peru is one of the most polluted cities in the Americas but has insufficient ground PM2.5 (particulate matter that are 2.5 μm or less in diameter) measurements to conduct epidemiologic studies regarding air pollution. PM2.5 estimates from a satellite-driven model have recently been made, enabling a study between asthma and PM2.5. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a daily time-series analysis to determine the association between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and estimated ambient PM2.5 levels in Lima, Peru from 2010 to 2016. METHODS: We used Poisson generalized linear models to regress aggregated counts of asthma on district-level population weighted PM2.5. Indicator variables for hospitals, districts, and day of week were included to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation while assessing same day, previous day, day before previous and average across all 3-day exposures. We also included temperature and humidity to account for meteorology and used dichotomous percent poverty and gender variables to assess effect modification. RESULTS: There were 103,974 cases of asthma ED visits during the study period across 39 districts in Lima. We found a 3.7% (95% CI: 1.7%-5.8%) increase in ED visits for every interquartile range (IQR, 6.02 μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 same day exposure with no age stratification. For the 0-18 years age group, we found a 4.5% (95% CI: 2.2%-6.8%) increase in ED visits for every IQR increase in PM2.5 same day exposure. For the 19-64 years age group, we found a 6.0% (95% CI: 1.0%-11.0%) increase in ED visits for every IQR in average 3-day exposure. For the 65 years and up age group, we found a 16.0% (95% CI: 7.0%-24.0%) decrease in ED visits for every IQR increase in PM2.5 average 3-day exposure, although the number of visits in this age group was low (4,488). We found no effect modification by SES or gender. DISCUSSION: Results from this study provide additional literature on use of satellite-driven exposure estimates in time-series analyses and evidence for the association between PM2.5 and asthma in a low- and middle-income (LMIC) country.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is currently a scarcity of air pollution epidemiologic data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the lack of air quality monitoring in these countries. Additionally, there is limited capacity to assess the health effects of wildfire smoke events in wildfire-prone regions like Brazil's Amazon Basin. Emerging low-cost air quality sensors may have the potential to address these gaps. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors for conducting air pollution epidemiologic research leveraging the United States Environmental Protection Agency's United States-wide correction formula for ambient PM2.5. METHODS: We obtained raw (uncorrected) PM2.5 concentration and humidity data from a PurpleAir sensor in Rio Branco, Brazil, between 2018 and 2019. Humidity measurements from the PurpleAir sensor were used to correct the PM2.5 concentrations. We established the relationship between ambient PM2.5 (corrected and uncorrected) and daily all-cause respiratory hospitalization in Rio Branco, Brazil, using generalized additive models (GAM) and distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM). We used linear regression to assess the relationship between daily PM2.5 concentrations and wildfire reports in Rio Branco during the wildfire seasons of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: We observed increases in daily respiratory hospitalizations of 5.4% (95%CI: 0.8%, 10.1%) for a 2-day lag and 5.8% (1.5%, 10.2%) for 3-day lag, per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 (corrected values). The effect estimates were attenuated when the uncorrected PM2.5 data was used. The number of reported wildfires explained 10% of daily PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season. DISCUSSION: Exposure-response relationships estimated using corrected low-cost air quality sensor data were comparable with relationships estimated using a validated air quality modeling approach. This suggests that correcting low-cost PM2.5 sensor data may mitigate bias attenuation in air pollution epidemiologic studies. Low-cost sensor PM2.5 data could also predict the air quality impacts of wildfires in Brazil's Amazon Basin.",

      "abstract": "Apart from concentrations of particulate mass, PM2.5-associated effects on health may largely depend on its chemical components. However, little is known regarding the underlying effects of specific PM2.5 constituents. The study included nearly 1 million hospital admissions from five Chinese cities during 2015-2017. Based on the modified Community Multiscale Air Quality model, our study simulated daily concentrations of PM2.5 and five main components. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models to estimate short-term effects of PM2.5 constituents on cause-specific hospital admissions. Per interquartile range increase in exposure to PM2.5, elemental carbon, organic carbon, nitrate, sulfate and ammonium at lag 04-day was related to an excess risk (ER%) for non-accidental admissions of 1.6% [95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.0], 1.9% [1.3-2.4], 1.0% [0.5-1.6], 1.2% [0.4-2.0], 1.2% [0.9-1.5] and 1.4% [0.9-1.9], respectively. Great heterogeneities of constituents-admission associations existed in diverse causes and constituents. This study provided multi-center high-quality evidence that hospital admissions, particularly those for ischemic heart disease (ER% ranging from 2.3 to 5.4% at lag 04-day) and pneumonia (1.9-5.1% at lag 4-day), could be triggered by short-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 constituents. Relatively stronger constituents-admission associations were found among females for respiratory causes and the elderly for cardiovascular causes.",

METHODS: Ecological study, carried out in the region of Grande Vitória, Espírito Santo, in the winter (June 21 to September 21, 2013) and summer (December 21, 2013 to March 19, 2014). We assessed data of daily count for outpatient care and hospitalization by respiratory diseases (ICD-10) in children from zero to 12 years in three hospitals in the Region of Grande Vitória. For collecting fine particulate matter, we used portable samplers of particles installed in six locations in the studied region. The Generalized Additive Model with Poisson distribution, fitted for the effects of predictor covariates, was used to evaluate the relationship between respiratory outcomes and concentration of fine particulate matter. RESULTS: The increase of 4.2 µg/m3 (interquartile range) in the concentration of fine particulate matter increased in 3.8% and 5.6% the risk of medical care or hospitalization, respectively, on the same day and with six-day lag from the exposure.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can have recurrent exacerbations and acute respiratory failure (ARF) triggered by particulate matter with a diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). To prevent ventilator shortages, this study investigated the short-term association between PM2.5 concentration and emergency department visits (EDVs) among patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: We conducted a time-series study to predict the PM2.5 concentration and number of ventilators needed. Daily counts of EDVs among AECOPD patients requiring ventilation from 2015 to 2019 were obtained from a hospital. Generalized linear models extending Poisson regression were used to explore the association of AECOPD with PM2.5 after controlling for the time trend, seasonal variations, and meteorological variables. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-five AECOPD patients receiving MV were recorded, of whom 734 received noninvasive ventilation and 141 received invasive ventilatory support. EDVs for AECOPD patients with ARF significantly increased by 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.51%-4.42%) per 10 μg m-3 increase in PM2.5 concentration. Among seasons, PM2.5 concentration had the strongest effect on AECOPD patients with ARF in spring (<24.5 °C), with a 1.64% (95% CI: -0.56% to 3.83%) increase in admissions per 10 μg m-3 increase in same-day PM2.5 concentration. The interquartile range increase of 20 μg m-3 between winter and spring was associated with an average EDV increase of 48.66%. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to predict the number of ventilators required by calculating quantitative estimates of the short-term effects of PM2.5 on EDVs for AECOPD patients with ARF. Adverse effects of PM2.5 on AECOPD patients requiring MV are evident, especially in the spring. Establishing protective standards and reducing the PM2.5 concentration to below various thresholds are urgently needed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fine particle (PM2.5) pollution related to combustion sources has been linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Although poorly understood, it is possible that organic carbon (OC) species, particularly those from combustion-related sources, may be partially responsible for the observed toxicity of PM2.5. The toxicity of the OC species may be related to their chemical structures; however, few studies have examined the association of OC species with health impacts. METHODS: We categorized 58 primary organic compounds by their chemical properties into 5 groups: n-alkanes, hopanes, cyclohexanes, PAHs and isoalkanes. We examined their impacts on the rate of daily emergency hospital admissions among Medicare recipients in Atlanta, GA and Birmingham, AL (2006-2009), and Dallas, TX (2006-2007). We analyzed data in two stages; we applied a case-crossover analysis to simultaneously estimate effects of individual OC species on cause-specific hospital admissions. In the second stage we estimated the OC chemical group-specific effects, using a multivariate weighted regression. RESULTS: Exposures to cyclohexanes of six days and longer were significantly and consistently associated with increased rate of hospital admissions for CVD (3.40%, 95%CI = (0.64, 6.24%) for 7-d exposure). Similar increases were found for hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. For respiratory related hospital admissions, associations with OC groups were less consistent, although exposure to iso-/anteiso-alkanes was associated with increased respiratory-related hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that week-long exposures to traffic-related, primary organic species are associated with increased rate of total and cause-specific CVD emergency hospital admissions. Associations were significant for cyclohexanes, but not hopanes, suggesting that chemical properties likely play an important role in primary OC toxicity.",

      "title": "Ambient air pollutants relate to hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Ganzhou, China.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between ambient air pollutants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in relatively low-polluted areas in China. METHODS: Atmospheric pollutants levels and meteorological data were obtained from January 2016 to December 2020. The medical database including daily hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD10: J44) was derived from the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University. The generalized additive model was used to analyze the percentage change with 95% confidence interval in daily hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with a 10 µg/m3 increase in atmospheric pollutants levels. RESULTS: In total, occurred 4,980 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospital admissions (not including emergency department visits) during 2016-2020. The mean concentrations of daily PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO were 37.5 μg/m3, 60.1 μg/m3, 18.7 μg/m3, 23.5 μg/m3, 70.0 μg/m3, and 1.2 mg/m3 in Ganzhou. Each 10 µg/m3 increment of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 were significantly associated with 2.8% (95%CI: 1.0-4.7), 1.3% (95%CI: 0.3-2.4), 2.8% (95%CI: 0.4-5.4), and 1.5% (95%CI: 0.2-2.7) elevation in daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospital admissions. The estimates of delayed effects of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 were observed at lag6, lag6, lag8, lag1, respectively. The health effects of particulate pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) may be independent of other pollutants. The adverse effects of air pollutants were more evident in the warm season (May-Oct) than in the cold season (Nov-Apr). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that elevated concentrations of atmospheric pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3), especially particulate pollutants, can be associated with increased daily count of hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which may promote further understanding of the potential hazards of relatively low levels of air pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory disorders.",

      "title": "Respiratory hospitalizations in association with fine PM and its components in New York State.",
      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Despite observed geographic and temporal variation in particulate matter (PM)-related health morbidities, only a small number of epidemiologic studies have evaluated the relation between PM2.5 chemical constituents and respiratory disease. Most assessments are limited by inadequate spatial and temporal resolution of ambient PM measurements and/or by their approaches to examine the role of specific PM components on health outcomes. In a case-crossover analysis using daily average ambient PM2.5 total mass and species estimates derived from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and available observations, we examined the association between the chemical components of PM (including elemental and organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and other remaining) and respiratory hospitalizations in New York State. We evaluated relationships between levels (low, medium, high) of PM constituent mass fractions, and assessed modification of the PM2.5-hospitalization association via models stratified by mass fractions of both primary and secondary PM components. In our results, average daily PM2.5 concentrations in New York State were generally lower than the 24-hr average National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Year-round analyses showed statistically significant positive associations between respiratory hospitalizations and PM2.5 total mass, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium concentrations at multiple exposure lags (0.5-2.0% per interquartile range [IQR] increase). Primarily in the summer months, the greatest associations with respiratory hospitalizations were observed per IQR increase in the secondary species sulfate and ammonium concentrations at lags of 1-4 days (1.0-2.0%). Although there were subtle differences in associations observed between mass fraction tertiles, there was no strong evidence to support modification of the PM2.5-respiratory disease association by a particular constituent. We conclude that ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and secondary aerosols including sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate were positively associated with respiratory hospitalizations, although patterns varied by season. Exposure to specific fine PM constituents is a plausible risk factor for respiratory hospitalization in New York State. IMPLICATIONS: The association between ambient concentrations of PM2.5 components has been evaluated in only a small number of epidemiologic studies with refined spatial and temporal scale data. In New York State, fine PM and several of its constituents, including sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate, were positively associated with respiratory hospitalizations. Results suggest that PM species relationships and their influence on respiratory endpoints are complex and season dependent. Additional work is needed to better understand the relative toxicity of PM species, and to further explore the role of co-pollutant relationships and exposure prediction error on observed PM-respiratory disease associations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been linked to respiratory diseases, while the effects of greenness remain inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and greenness (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) with respiratory emergency room visits and hospitalizations across seven Northern European centers in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) study. METHODS: We used modified mixed-effects Poisson regression to analyze associations of exposure in 1990, 2000 and mean exposure 1990-2000 with respiratory outcomes recorded duing ECRHS phases II and III. We assessed interactions of air pollution and greenness, and of atopic status (defined by nasal allergies and hay fever status) and greenness, on these outcomes. RESULTS: The analysis included 1675 participants, resulting in 119 emergency visits and 48 hospitalizations. Increased PM2.5 by 5 μg/m³ was associated with higher relative risk (RR) of emergency visits (1990: RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00-1.35; 2000: RR 1.24, 95% CI: 0.98-1.57; 1990-2000: RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.97-1.41) and hospitalizations (1990: RR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.00-2.01; 2000: RR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.43-3.38; 1990-2000: RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.04-2.00). Similar trends were observed for PM10, BC, and NO2, with only PM10 showing significant associations with hospitalizations across all periods. No associations were found for O3. Greenness exposure was linked to more emergency visits in 2000 but to fewer hospitalizations in 1990. Significant interactions were observed between greenness and atopic status for emergency visits, and between NDVI with O3 and BC for some time windows. CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to particulate matter was associated with increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Significant associations were observed for BC and NO2 with hospitalizations. No link was found with O3. Greenness indicated a lower risk of hospitalizations, but increased risks for emergency visits for those with atopic status.",

      "title": "Associations of wildfire smoke PM",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Substantial increases in wildfire activity have been recorded in recent decades. Wildfires influence the chemical composition and concentration of particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). However, relatively few epidemiologic studies focus on the health impacts of wildfire smoke PM2.5 compared with the number of studies focusing on total PM2.5 exposure. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the associations between cardiorespiratory acute events and exposure to smoke PM2.5 in Colorado using a novel exposure model to separate smoke PM2.5 from background ambient PM2.5 levels. METHODS: We obtained emergency department visits and hospitalizations for acute cardiorespiratory outcomes from Colorado for May-August 2011-2014, geocoded to a 4 km geographic grid. Combining ground measurements, chemical transport models, and remote sensing data, we estimated smoke PM2.5 and non-smoke PM2.5 on a 1 km spatial grid and aggregated to match the resolution of the health data. Time-stratified, case-crossover models were fit using conditional logistic regression to estimate associations between fire smoke PM2.5 and non-smoke PM2.5 for overall and age-stratified outcomes using 2-day averaging windows for cardiovascular disease and 3-day windows for respiratory disease. RESULTS: Per 1 μg/m3 increase in fire smoke PM2.5, statistically significant associations were observed for asthma (OR = 1.081 (1.058, 1.105)) and combined respiratory disease (OR = 1.021 (1.012, 1.031)). No significant relationships were evident for cardiovascular diseases and smoke PM2.5. Associations with non-smoke PM2.5 were null for all outcomes. Positive age-specific associations related to smoke PM2.5 were observed for asthma and combined respiratory disease in children, and for asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and combined respiratory disease in adults. No significant associations were found in older adults. DISCUSSION: This is the first multi-year, high-resolution epidemiologic study to incorporate statistical and chemical transport modeling methods to estimate PM2.5 exposure due to wildfires. Our results allow for a more precise assessment of the population health impact of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure in a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence of health risks associated with ambient airborne fine particles in nonurban populations is extremely limited. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the risk of hospitalization associated with short-term exposures to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in urban and nonurban counties with population ≥ 50,000. METHODS: We utilized a database of daily cardiovascular- and respiratory-related hospitalization rates constructed from Medicare National Claims History files (2002-2006), including 28 million Medicare beneficiaries in 708 counties. Daily PM2.5 exposures were estimated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) downscaler. We used time-series analysis of hospitalization rates and PM2.5 to evaluate associations between PM2.5 levels and hospitalization risk in single-pollutant models. RESULTS: We observed an association between cardiovascular hospitalizations and same-day PM2.5 with higher risk in urban counties: 0.35% [95% posterior interval (PI): -0.71%, 1.41%] and 0.98% (95% PI: 0.73%, 1.23%) increases in hospitalization risk per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 were observed in the least-urban and most-urban counties, respectively. The largest association for respiratory hospitalizations, a 2.57% (95% PI: 0.87%, 4.30%) increase per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, was observed in the least-urban counties; in the most-urban counties, a 1.13% (0.73%, 1.54%) increase was observed. Effect estimates for cardiovascular hospitalizations were highest for smaller lag times, whereas effect estimates for respiratory hospitalizations increased as more days of exposure were included. CONCLUSION: In nonurban counties with population ≥ 50,000, exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased risk for respiratory hospitalizations; in urban counties, exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations. Effect estimates based on a single day of exposure may underestimate true effects for respiratory hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "Background: Previous studies suggested that exposure to air pollution could increase risk of asthma attacks in children. The aim of this study is to investigate the short-term effects of exposure to ambient air pollution on asthma hospital admissions in children in Beijing, a city with serious air pollution and high-quality medical care at the same time. Methods: We collected hospital admission data of asthma patients aged ≤ 18 years old from 56 hospitals from 2013 to 2016 in Beijing, China. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional Poisson regression were applied to explore the association between risk of asthma admission in children and the daily concentration of six air pollutants [particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3)], adjusting for meteorological factors and other pollutants. Additionally, stratified analyses were performed by age, gender, and season. Results: In the single-pollutant models, higher levels of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 were significantly associated with increased risk of hospital admission for asthma in children. The strongest effect was observed in NO2 at lag06 (RR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.06-1.48), followed by SO2 at lag05 (RR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.05-1.31). The robustness of effects of SO2 and NO2 were shown in two-pollutant models. Stratified analyses further indicated that pre-school children (aged ≤ 6 years) were more susceptible to SO2. The effects of SO2 were stronger in the cold season, while the effects of NO2 were stronger in the warm season. No significant sex-specific differences were observed. Conclusions: These results suggested that high levels of air pollution had an adverse effect on childhood asthma, even in a region with high-quality healthcare. Therefore, it will be significant to decrease hospital admissions for asthma in children by controlling air pollution emission and avoiding exposure to air pollution.",

      "abstract": "The influences of weather and air pollutants on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been well-studied. However, the heterogeneous effects of different influenza viral infections, air pollution and weather on COPD admissions and re-admissions have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationships between meteorological variables, air pollutants, seasonal influenza, and hospital admissions and re-admissions due to COPD in Hong Kong, a non-industrial influenza epicenter. A total number of 507703 hospital admissions (i.e., index admissions) and 301728 re-admission episodes (i.e., episodes within 30 days after the previous discharge) for COPD over 14 years (1998-2011) were obtained from all public hospitals. The aggregated weekly numbers were matched with meteorological records and outdoor air pollutant concentrations. Type-specific and all-type influenza-like illness positive (ILI+) rates were used as proxies for influenza activity. Generalized additive models were used in conjunction with distributed-lag non-linear models to estimate the associations of interest. According to the results, high concentrations of fine particulate matter, oxidant gases, and cold weather were strong independent risk factors of COPD outcomes. The cumulative adjusted relative risks exhibited a monotone increasing trend except for ILI+ B, and the numbers were statistically significant over the entire observed range of ILI+ total and ILI+ A/H3N2 when the reference rate was zero. COPD hospitalization risk from influenza infection was higher in the elderly than that in the general population. In conclusion, our results suggest that health administrators should impose clean air policies, such as strengthening emissions control on petrol vehicles, to reduce pollution from oxidant gases and particulates. An extension of the influenza vaccination program for patients with COPD may need to be encouraged: for example, vaccination may be included in hospital discharge planning, particularly before the winter epidemic.",

      "abstract": "Ambient hydrocarbons are important precursors of ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation. However, few studies have assessed the health impact of airborne hydrocarbons. We conducted this time series ecological study to evaluate the association of short-term airborne hydrocarbons exposure with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, while controlling for co-exposure to criteria pollutants. Taipei air pollution and weather data for the period spanning from January 2010 to December 2017 were obtained from Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network. Subsequently, daily pollutant concentrations were linked with daily hospital admission counts for respiratory diseases into a time series data frame. The standard generalized additive Poisson model adjusted for temporal trends, seasonal variations, weather conditions, and calendar effects, was applied to examine the short-term associations of acute airborne hydrocarbon exposure with respiratory hospital admissions. Next, the robustness of the associations was tested using two-pollutant models with further adjustment for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants. The results demonstrated that an interquartile range increase in non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) exposure on lag0 day (0.15 ppm) was associated with a 0.86% (95% confidence interval: 0.37%-1.36%), 2.06% (0.77%-3.38%), and 1.25% (0.31%-2.20%) increment in all-respiratory-disease-, asthma-, and chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-linked hospital admissions, respectively. The associations were robust with further adjustment for co-exposure to PM2.5 and ozone. The acute effect estimate of methane on each respiratory category was sensitive to the co-pollutant adjustment and lost statistical significance in the two-pollutant models. In conclusion, we confirmed that airborne NMHC exposure increased the risk of respiratory-disease-related hospital admissions in Taipei; this information may aid in the regulation of hydrocarbon pollution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies differentiating the cardiorespiratory morbidity effects of PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5∼10 (i.e. coarse PM or PMc) are still limited and inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the acute, cumulative, and harvesting effects of exposure to the three size-specific PM on cardiorespiratory morbidity, and their concentration-response relations. METHODS: A total of 6,727,439 emergency department (ED) visits were collected from 16 public teaching hospitals in Guangzhou, from January 1st 2012 to December 31st 2015, among which over 2.1 million were asthma, COPD, pneumonia, respiratory tract infection (RTI), hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) was used to estimate the associations between the three size-specific PM and ED visits for the cardiovascular diseases. Long-term trends, seasonality, influenza epidemics, meteorological factors, and other gas pollutants, including SO2, NO2, and O3, were adjusted. We stratified the analyses by gender and age. RESULTS: Elevated PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with increased ED visits for pneumonia, RTI, and CHD at both lag0 and lag0-3. A 10 μg/m3 increment of PMc (at lag0-14) was estimated to increase ED visits for pneumonia by 6.32% (95% CI, 4.19, 8.49) and for RTI by 4.72% (95% CI, 3.81, 5.63), respectively. PMc showed stronger cumulative effects on asthma in children than elderly. We observed significant harvesting effects (i.e. morbidity displacements) of the three size-specific PM on respiratory but very little on cardiovascular ED visits. The concentration-response curves suggested non-linear relations between exposures to the three different sizes of PM and respiratory morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the three size-specific PM demonstrated distinct acute and cumulative effects on the cardiorespiratory diseases. PM2.5 and PMc would have significant effects on pneumonia and RTI. Strategies should be considered to further reduce levels of ambient PM2.5 and PMc.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The 2006-2007 wildfire period was one of the most extensive and long lasting fires in Australian history with high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ). Large populations were exposed to smoke for over 2 months. The study aimed to investigate the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma. METHODS: A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to investigate associations between daily average PM2.5 and ED attendances for asthma from December 2006 to January 2007. ED data were obtained from the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset. Smoke dispersion during the wildfire event was modelled using a validated chemical transport model. Exposure data (daily average PM2.5 , temperature and relative humidity) were modelled for the study period. Various lag periods were investigated. RESULTS: There were 2047 ED attendances for asthma during the study period. After adjusting for temperature and relative humidity, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 levels of 8.6 μg/m(3) was associated with an increase in ED attendances for asthma by 1.96% (95%CI: 0.02, 3.94) on the day of exposure. Lag periods up to 2 days prior did not show any association. A strong association was observed among women 20 years and older (5.08% 95%CI: 1.76, 8.51). CONCLUSIONS: Wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of ED attendance for asthma during the wildfire event. It is important to understand the role of wildfire PM2.5 as a trigger for asthma presentations.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we estimated the short-term effects of ambient air pollution on respiratory disease hospitalization in Taiyuan, China. Daily data of respiratory disease hospitalization, daily concentration of ambient air pollutants and meteorological factors from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2017 in Taiyuan were included in our study. We conducted a time-series study design and applied a generalized additive model to evaluate the association between every 10-μg/m³ increment of air pollutants and percent increase of respiratory disease hospitalization. A total of 127,565 respiratory disease hospitalization cases were included in this study during the present period. In single-pollutant models, the effect values in multi-day lags were greater than those in single-day lags. PM2.5 at lag02 days, SO₂ at lag03 days, PM10 and NO₂ at lag05 days were observed to be strongly and significantly associated with respiratory disease hospitalization. No significant association was found between O₃ and respiratory disease hospitalization. SO₂ and NO₂ were still significantly associated with hospitalization after adjusting for PM2.5 or PM10 into two-pollutant models. Females and younger population for respiratory disease were more vulnerable to air pollution than males and older groups. Therefore, some effective measures should be taken to strengthen the management of the ambient air pollutants, especially SO₂ and NO₂, and to enhance the protection of the high-risk population from air pollutants, thereby reducing the burden of respiratory disease caused by ambient air pollution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrafine particles (UFP; <0.1 µm in diameter) are not regulated or commonly monitored but may be harmful to human health, particularly for children. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between short-term exposure to UFP and asthma hospital admissions in children. METHODS: Daily UFP concentrations (2002-2018) were monitored at an urban background station in Copenhagen, Denmark. Asthma hospital admissions, demographic and socioeconomic information of children (0-18 years) were obtained from registries. A case-crossover design was applied to estimate the association between hospital admissions and up to 6-day UFP exposure windows for all children, and stratified by age, sex, family income, mother's education, prior asthma or prior respiratory infection. RESULTS: We observed 15 903 asthma hospital admissions in total. An IQR increase in UFP was significantly associated with asthma hospital admissions, strongest at 2-day exposure windows (risk ratio (RR): 1.17 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.25)). These associations remained unchanged when adjusting for particulate matter <2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2), for which we also detected significant positive associations. Associations with UFP were stronger for school-aged children (5-14 years: RR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.38)) than for children younger than 5 years (1.01 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.10)). CONCLUSIONS: In this large study in a low-exposure setting, we find that short-term exposure to UFP can trigger asthma hospital admissions in children, independently of associations with PM2.5 or NO2. This study adds evidence calling for the regulation and improvement of UFP exposure assessment to protect children's health in urban areas.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Short-term exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP; <100 nm) may trigger respiratory hospitalizations, potentially even more so among children than adults, but available evidence is limited. We examined the association between short-term UFP exposure and respiratory infection hospital admissions in children in Copenhagen, Denmark. METHODS: Daily concentrations of UFP were monitored at an urban background station during 2002-2018. Hospital admissions for lower and upper respiratory infections (LRTIs/URTIs), pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza in children (0-18 years) were obtained from the Danish National Patient Register. Associations between UFP concentrations up to one week prior to admission and hospital admissions were examined using case-crossover design. Relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated per interquartile range (IQR) increase in UFP for the total population, and by sex, age (0-4/5-14/15-18 years) and socio-economic status (income, mother's education). RESULTS: We observed 109,585 hospital admissions for respiratory infections. We found positive associations of UFP with total respiratory infections, URTIs, and pneumonia with RRs of 1.04 (95 % CI: 1.01, 1.06), 1.04 (1.01, 1.08), and 1.06 (1.01, 1.12), respectively, per IQR increase in three-day mean UFP (lag 0-2), that were robust to PM2.5 and NO2 adjustment. Associations were stronger in boys and children younger than 15 years, with no differences between socio-economic groups. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to UFP triggered hospital admissions for respiratory infections, especially URTIs and pneumonia, in children in Copenhagen independently from PM2.5 and NO2. Our findings emphasize the need for policies and regulations aimed at improving urban air quality to protect children's health.",

      "abstract": "Evidence between air pollution and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is inconsistent and limited in China. In this study, we aim to examine the associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions for COPD, hoping to provide practical advice for prevention and control of COPD. Hospital admissions for COPD were collected from a Grade-A tertiary hospital in Jinan from 2014 to 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to examine the associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions for COPD. Stratified analysis was also conducted for gender, age (20-74 and ≥75 years), and season (warm and cold). The avoidable number of COPD hospital admissions was calculated when air pollutants were controlled under national and WHO standards. Over the study period, a total of 4,012 hospital admissions for COPD were recorded. The daily hospital admissions of COPD increased by 2.36% (95%CI: 0.13-4.65%) and 2.39% (95%CI: 0.19-4.65%) for per 10 μg/m3 increase of NO2 and SO2 concentrations at lag2, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in health effects caused by increased concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CO, and O3. The health effects of increased SO2 concentration were stronger in women, the ≥75 years old people and the cold season. About 2 (95%CI: 0-3), 64 (95%CI: 4-132) and 86 (95%CI: 6-177) COPD admissions would be avoided when the SO2 concentration was controlled below the NAAQS-II (150 μg/m3), NAAQS-I (50 μg/m3), and WHO's AQG2021 standard (40 μg/m3), respectively. These findings suggest that short-term exposure to NO2 and SO2 was associated with increased risks of daily COPD admissions, especially for females and the elderly. The control of SO2 and NO2 under the national and WHO standards could avoid more COPD admissions and obtain greater health benefits.",

The aim of the study was to assess the risk related to NOx, NO2 and PM2.5 concentration increase and daily outpatient visits or hospitalization due to bronchitis and asthma exacerbation in the entire population of Silesian Voivodeship, Poland. To assess the relationship between daily pollutants concentrations and the number of outpatient visits or hospitalizations due to bronchitis and asthma (available in the regional registry), the multivariable log-linear Poisson regression model was used. Results were presented by relative risk (RR) of health outcomes related to the increase in pollutant concentration by unit (interquartile range). Obtained results confirmed a statistically significant association between outpatient visits and hospitalizations due to bronchitis and asthma exacerbation and daily nitrogen oxides concentrations in Silesian voivodeship, Poland. The strongest relationship was observed in the case of NO2 and outpatient visits due to bronchitis, e.g., RR = 1.434 (1.308-1.571) for exposure expressed by the 50-day moving average concentration. In the case of hospitalizations, the health effect was lagged a few days in relation to the increase in exposure.",

Our data indicated that PM2.5 concentration from ADS was highly correlated with ER visits for CVDs and RDs. The odds ratios (OR) increased by 2.92 (95% CI: 1.22-5.08) and 1.86 (95% CI: 1.30-2.91) per 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 levels, for CVDs and RDs, respectively. A 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 from ADSs was significantly associated with an increase in ER visits for CVDs among those 65 years of age and older (an increase of 2.77 in OR) and for females (an increase of 3.09 in OR). In contrast, PM2.5 levels had a significant impact on RD ER visits among those under 65 years of age (OR = 1.77). The risk of ER visits for CVDs increased on the day when the ADS occurred in Taiwan and the day after (lag 0 and lag 1); the corresponding risk increase for RDs only increased on the fifth day after the ADS (lag 5). In Taiwan's late winter and spring, the severity of ER visits for CVDs and RDs increases. Environmental protection agencies should employ an early warning system for ADS to reduce high-risk groups' exposure to PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and aeroallergens (i.e., pollen, molds) are known triggers of asthma exacerbation. Despite mechanistic evidence suggesting synergistic effects between PM2.5 and asthma exacerbation, little epidemiologic work has been performed in children, which has exhibited inconsistency. We conducted a time-series study to explore their interactions using electronic health records (EHR) data in Philadelphia, PA, for asthma diagnoses in outpatient, emergency department [ED], and inpatient settings. Daily asthma exacerbation cases (28,540 asthma exacerbation case encounters) were linked to daily ambient PM2.5 and daily aeroallergen levels during the aeroallergen season of a six-year period (mid-March to October 2011-2016). Asthma exacerbation counts were modeled using quasi-Poisson regression, where PM2.5 and aeroallergens were fitted with distributed lag non-linear functions (lagged from 0 to 14-days), respectively, when modeled as the primary exposure variables. Regression models were adjusted for mean daily temperature/relative humidity, long-term and seasonal trends, day-of-week, and major U.S. holidays. Increasing gradient of RR estimates were observed for only a few primary exposure risk factors [PM2.5 (90th vs. 5th percentile)/aeroallergens (90th percentile vs. 0)], across different levels of effect modifiers. For example, RRs for the association between late-season grass pollen (lag1) and asthma exacerbation were higher at higher levels of PM2.5, 5-days preceding the exacerbation event (low PM2.5: RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.93-1.09; medium PM2.5: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12; high PM2.5: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19). However, most of the highest RRs for aeroallergens were instead observed for days with low- or medium- PM2.5 levels; likewise, when PM2.5 was modeled as the primary exposure with aeroallergens as the effect modifier. Most of the RR estimates did not exhibit gradients that suggested synergism, and were of relatively high imprecision. Overall, our study suggested no evidence for interactions between PM2.5 and aeroallergens in their relationships with childhood asthma exacerbation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in early life, including pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis, can lead to decreased lung function, persistent lung damage and increased susceptibility to various respiratory diseases such as asthma. In-utero exposure to particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy may disrupt biological mechanisms that regulate fetal growth, maturation and development. We aimed to estimate the association between intrauterine exposure to PM of size < 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and incidence of LRTIs during the first year of life. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study in a population of mothers and infants born in Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) in the years 2004-2012. All infants < 1 year old that were hospitalized due to LRTIs were included. The main exposure assessment was based on a hybrid model incorporating daily satellite-based predictions at 1 km2 spatial resolution. Data from monitoring stations was used for imputation of main exposure and other pollutants. Levels of environmental exposures were assigned to subjects based on their residential addresses and averaged for each trimester. Analysis was conducted by a multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) Poisson regression. Data was analyzed separately for the two main ethnic groups in the region, Jewish and Arab-Bedouin. RESULTS: The study cohort included 57,331 deliveries that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 1871 hospitalizations of infants < 1 year old due to pneumonia or bronchiolitis were documented. In a multivariable analysis, intrauterine exposure to high levels of PM2.5 (> 24 μg/m3) in the first and second trimesters was found to be adversely associated with LRTIs in the Arab-Bedouin population (1st trimester, RR = 1.31, CI 95% 1.08-1.60; 2nd trimester: RR = 1.34, CI 95% 1.09-1.66). CONCLUSION: Intrauterine exposure to high levels of PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of hospitalizations due to lower respiratory tract infections in Arab-Bedouin infants.",

      "abstract": "The influence of temperature on childhood asthma was self-evident, yet the issue of whether the relationship will be synergized by air pollution remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between short-term temperature exposure and childhood asthma hospitalization was modified by particulate matter (PM). Data on childhood asthma hospitalization, meteorological factors, and air pollutants during 2013-2016 in Hefei, China, were collected. First, a basic Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to assess the temperature-childhood asthma hospitalization relationship. Then, two interactive strategies were applied to explore the modification effect of PM on the temperature-childhood asthma hospitalization association. We found a greater effect of cold (5th percentile of temperature) on asthma during days with higher PM2.5 (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.38) or PM10 (RR: 1.87, 95% CI:1.20, 2.91) than that during days with lower PM2.5 (RR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.54) or PM10 (RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.98, 2.36). In addition, we observed a greater modification effect of PM2.5 on the cold-asthma association than did PM10, with a per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 associated with increases of 0.065 and 0.025 for the RR corresponding to the 5th temperature percentile, respectively. For the temperature-related AF, moderate cold showed the largest change magnitude with the PM levels rising compared with other temperature ranges. For the subgroup, Females and those aged 6-18 years were more sensitive to the modification effect of PM2.5 or PM10 on the cold-asthma association. Our findings demonstrated that particulate matter could modify the associations between temperature and childhood asthma hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "Increased ambient concentration of particulate matters are considered as one of major causes for increased prevalence or exacerbation of asthma or asthma like symptoms. Recently, possible temporal variation in risks of PM on mortality has been suggested. We investigated short-term effect of both PM10 and PM2.5 on asthma hospitalization, and assessed temporal variation of PM risks in Seoul, Korea, 2003-2011. Generalized additive model was used to estimate PM risks on asthma hospitalization with consideration by long-term trend, influenza epidemic, day of week, meteorological factors. To assess temporal variation of PM risks, year-round PM risks were estimated. Stratified analysis by season and age-group were also conducted. Estimated RRs of PM on asthma hospitalization by an increase of 10㎍/㎥were 1.0084 (95% CI: 1.0041-1.0127) and 1.0156 (95% CI: 1.0055-1.0259) respectively with 7-days lag periods (lag06). PM2.5 had stronger effect than PM10 for all age group. Elderly group was most affected by PM. For the analysis of temporal variation of PM risks, we found increasing trend in total population and the elderly group. In the season-specific analysis, we also found increasing trend in winter for PM10, and in spring for PM2.5. PM10 and PM2.5 has adverse effect on asthma hospitalization with evidence suggesting temporal variation in PM risks. Further research will be needed to confirm the temporal variation of PM risk on asthma hospitalization, and to identify casual factors affecting this temporal variation. This study results could be evidentiary materials for establishing valid public health policies to reduce health burden or economic burden of asthma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given that fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) is a mixture of multiple components, it has been of high interest to identify its specific health-relevant physical and/or chemical features. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a time-series study of PM2.5 and cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits in the St. Louis, Missouri-Illinois metropolitan area, using 2 years of daily PM2.5 and PM2.5 component measurements (including ions, carbon, particle-phase organic compounds, and elements) made at the St. Louis-Midwest Supersite, a monitoring site of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Supersites ambient air monitoring research program. METHODS: Using Poisson generalized linear models, we assessed short-term associations between daily cardiorespiratory ED visit counts and daily levels of 24 selected pollutants. Associations were estimated for interquartile range changes in each pollutant. To allow comparison of relationships among multiple pollutants and outcomes with potentially different lag structures, we used 3-day unconstrained distributed lag models controlling for time trends and meteorology. RESULTS: Considering results of our primary models, as well as sensitivity analyses and models assessing co-pollutant confounding, we observed robust associations of cardiovascular disease visits with 17α(H),21β(H)-hopane and congestive heart failure visits with elemental carbon. We also observed a robust association of respiratory disease visits with ozone. For asthma/wheeze, associations were strongest with ozone and nitrogen dioxide; observed associations of asthma/wheeze with PM2.5 and its components were attenuated in two-pollutant models with these gases. Differential measurement error due to differential patterns of spatiotemporal variability may have influenced patterns of observed associations across pollutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings add to the growing field examining the health effects of PM2.5 components. Combustion-related components of the pollutant mix showed particularly strong associations with cardiorespiratory ED visit outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately nine million adults in the United States are living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and positive associations between short-term air pollution exposure and increased risk of COPD hospitalizations in older adults are consistently reported. We examined the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospitalizations and assessed if there is modification by long-term exposure in a cohort of individuals with COPD. METHODS: In a time-referent case-crossover design, we used a cohort of randomly selected individuals with electronic health records from the University of North Carolina Healthcare System, restricted to patients with a medical encounter coded with a COPD diagnosis from 2004-2016 (n = 520), and estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from an ensemble model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR (95%CI)) were estimated with conditional logistic regression for respiratory-related, cardiovascular (CVD), and all-cause hospitalizations. Exposures examined were 0-2 and 0-3 day lags of PM2.5 concentration, adjusting for daily census-tract temperature and humidity, and models were stratified by long-term (annual average) PM2.5 concentration at the median value. RESULTS: We observed generally null or low-magnitude negative associations with short-term PM2.5 exposure and respiratory-related (OR per 5 µg/m3 increase in 3-day lag PM2.5: 0.971 (0.885, 1.066)), CVD (2-day lag: 0.976 (0.900, 1.058) and all-cause (3 day lag: 1.003 (0.927, 1.086)) hospitalizations. Associations between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospitalizations were higher among patients residing in areas with higher levels of annual PM2.5 concentrations (OR per 5 µg/m3 in 3-day lag PM2.5 for all-cause hospitalizations: 1.066 (0.958, 1.185)) than those in areas with lower annual PM2.5 concentrations (OR per 5 µg/m3 in 3-day lag PM2.5 for all-cause hospitalizations: 0.914 (0.804, 1.039)). CONCLUISONS: Differences in associations demonstrate that people in areas with higher annual PM2.5 exposure may be associated with higher risk of hospitalization during short-term increases in PM2.5 exposure.",

      "abstract": "High levels of air pollutants in Vietnam, especially particulate matters including PM2.5, can be important risk factors for respiratory diseases among children of the country. However, few studies on the effects of ambient air pollution on human health have been conducted in Vietnam so far. The aim of this study is to examine the association between PM2.5 and hospital admission due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) among children aged < 5 years old in Ho Chi Minh city, the largest city of Vietnam. Data relating PM2.5 and hospital admission were collected from February 2016-December 2017 and a time series regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between PM2.5 and hospital admission including the delayed effect up to three days prior to the admission. We found that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an increase of 3.51 (95%CI: 0.96-6.12) risk of ALRI admission among children. According to the analysis, male children are more sensitive to exposure to PM2.5 than females, while children exposed to PM2.5 are more likely to be infected with acute bronchiolitis than with pneumonia. The study demonstrated that young children in HCMC are at increased risk of ALRI admissions due to the high level of PM2.5 concentration in the city's ambient air.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identify the association between exposure to fine particulate matter and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases in children up to ten years of age in the city of Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, stratifying the analysis by sex and calculating excess costs. METHODS: Ecological study of time series. The dependent variable was daily hospitalizations according to the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10): J04.0, J12.0 to J18.9, J20.0 to J21.9 and J45.0 to J45.0. The independent variables were the concentration of fine particulate, estimated by a mathematical model, temperature and relative air humidity, controlled by short and long-term trends. Generalized additive model of Poisson regression was used. Relative risks, proportional attributable risk (PAR) and excess hospitalizations and their respective costs by the population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated. RESULTS: 1,165 children were hospitalized, 640 males and 525 females. The mean concentration, estimated by the mathematical model, was 15.1±2.9 mcg/m3 for PM2.5. For boys, there was no significant association; for girls a relative risk of up to 1.04 of daily hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases was observed for exposure to PM 2.5 in lags 1, 2 and 6. Increase of 5 µg/m3 in these concentrations increased the percentage of the risk in 18%; with an excess 95 hospital admissions and with excess expenses in the order of US$ 35 thousand. CONCLUSIONS: Significant effect in daily hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases related to exposure to fine particulate matter was noted for girls, suggesting the need for stratification by sex in further studies. OBJETIVO:: Identificar associação entre exposição ao material particulado fino e internações por doenças respiratórias em crianças de até dez anos de idade, no município de Cuiabá, MT, estratificando a análise por sexo e calculando excesso de custos. MÉTODOS:: Estudo ecológico de séries temporais, sendo a variável dependente o número diário de internações por doenças respiratórias, segundo a 10a Revisão da Classificação Internacional de Doenças (CID): J04.0, J12.0 a J18.9, J20.0 a J21.9 e J45.0 a J45.0. As variáveis independentes foram a concentração do particulado fino, estimada pelo modelo matemático, além de temperatura e umidade relativa do ar, controladas pelas tendências de curta e longa duração. Foram calculados riscos relativos, risco atribuível proporcional (RAP) e excessos de internações e seus respectivos custos pela fração atribuível populacional (FAP). RESULTADOS:: Foram internadas 1.165 crianças (640 meninos e 525 meninas). A concentração média estimada do particulado fino foi 15,1±2,9 mcg/m3 para particulado fino (PM2,5). Para meninos, não houve associação significativa. Para meninas, observou-se risco relativo (RR) de até 1,04 para o número diário de internações por doenças respiratórias em associação à exposição ao PM2,5 nos lags 1, 2 e 6. O aumento de 5 mcg/m3 nessas concentrações associou-se ao aumento do risco em 18% e o RAP atribuído à exposição foi de 20% das internações das meninas, com excesso de 95 internações e de gastos da ordem de R$ 105 mil. CONCLUSÕES:: Houve associação da exposição ao particulado fino e número de internações por doenças respiratórias de meninas, sugerindo a necessidade de estratificação por sexos em estudos posteriores.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: PM2.5 exposure is associated with pulmonary and airway inflammation, and the health impact might vary by PM2.5 constitutes. This study evaluated the effects of increased short-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related emergency department (ED) visits and determined the susceptible groups. METHODS: This retrospective observational study performed in a medical center from 2007 to 2010, and enrolled non-trauma patients aged >20 years who visited the emergency department (ED) and were diagnosed as COPD. Concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and the four PM2.5 components, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO3-), and sulfate (SO42-), were collected by three PM supersites in Kaohsiung City. We used an alternative design of the Poisson time series regression models called a time-stratified and case-crossover design to analyze the data. RESULTS: Per interquartile range (IQR) increment in PM2.5 level on lag 2 were associated with increments of 6.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-13.0%) in risk of COPD exacerbation. An IQR increase in elemental carbon (EC) was significantly associated with an increment of 3.0% (95% CI, 0.1-5.9%) in risk of COPD exacerbation on lag 0. Meanwhile, an IQR increase in sulfate, nitrate, and OC levels was not significantly associated with COPD. Patients were more sensitive to the harmful effects of EC on COPD during the warm season (interaction p = 0.019). The risk of COPD exacerbation after exposure to PM2.5 was higher in individuals who are currently smoking, with malignancy, or during cold season, but the differences did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: PM2.5 and EC may play an important role in COPD events in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Patients were more susceptible to the adverse effects of EC on COPD on warm days.",

      "title": "Power outage mediates the associations between major storms and hospital admission of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third-leading cause of death worldwide with continuous rise. Limited studies indicate that COPD was associated with major storms and related power outages (PO). However, significant gaps remain in understanding what PO's role is on the pathway of major storms-COPD. This study aimed to examine how PO mediates the major storms-COPD associations. METHODS: In this time-series study, we extracted all hospital admissions with COPD as the principal diagnosis in New York, 2001-2013. Using distributed lag nonlinear models, the hospitalization rate during major storms and PO was compared to non-major storms and non-PO periods to determine the risk ratios (RRs) for COPD at each of 0-6 lag days respectively after controlling for time-varying confounders and concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We then used Granger mediation analysis for time series to assess the mediation effect of PO on the major storms-COPD associations. RESULTS: The RRs of COPD hospitalization following major storms, which mainly included flooding, thunder, hurricane, snow, ice, and wind, were 1.23 to 1.49 across lag 0-6 days. The risk was strongest at lag3 and lasted significantly for 4 days. Compared with non-outage periods, the PO period was associated with 1.23 to 1.61 higher risk of COPD admissions across lag 0-6 days. The risk lasted significantly for 2 days and was strongest at lag2. Snow, hurricane and wind were the top three contributors of PO among the major storms. PO mediated as much as 49.6 to 65.0% of the major storms-COPD associations. CONCLUSIONS: Both major storms and PO were associated with increased hospital admission of COPD. PO mediated almost half of the major storms-COPD hospitalization associations. Preparation of surrogate electric system before major storms is essential to reduce major storms-COPD hospitalization.",

To explore whether high concentrations of air pollutants (including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2) are related to hospital visits for pneumonia in children, we conducted a population-based time-series study in Ningbo, China, from January 1st, 2014 to November 1st, 2015. We used a generalized additive Poisson regression model to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the associations of air pollutants and hospital visits for pneumonia in children and found that these four pollutants were associated with the increased hospital visits for pneumonia in children (1.3% for PM2.5, 1.0% for PM10, 2.9% for NO2, 5.0% for SO2 per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2, respectively). Stronger associations were observed in the cold seasons and among children under 5 years.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the change in rates of hospital emergency presentations or hospital admissions during the coal mine fire, and their associations with the coal mine fire-related fine particles (PM2.5). METHODS: Daily data on hospital emergency presentations and admissions were collected from the Department of Health and Human Services for the period January 01, 2009 to June 30, 2015, at Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2). The coal mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations were modelled by the Chemical Transport Model coupled with the Cubic Conformal Atmospheric Model. A generalised additive mixed model was used to estimate the change in rates of hospital emergency presentations and hospital admissions during the coal mine fire period, and to examine their associations with PM2.5 concentrations for smoke impacted areas, after controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with non-fire periods, we found increased risks of all-causes, respiratory diseases, and asthma related emergency presentations and hospital admissions as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) related emergency presentations during the fire period. Associations between daily concentrations of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 and emergency presentations for all-causes and respiratory diseases, including COPD and asthma, appeared after two days' exposure. Associations with hospital admissions for cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases appeared on the same day of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Coal mine fire smoke created a substantial health burden. People with respiratory diseases should receive targeted messages, follow self-management plans and take preventive medication during future coal mine fires.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite familiarity with triggers for asthma, there is little recent study on the association of triggers with the emergency department (ED) presentation of adult asthma exacerbation. METHODS: Retrospective electronic chart review of adult patients treated in an urban teaching hospital ED with chief complaint and diagnostic coding related to asthma and upper respiratory tract infection (URI) was conducted. Monthly aeroallergen data and environmental conditions were obtained from a local allergen extract laboratory and local government sources. Data analysis was performed using Newey-West time series regression modeling with adjustment for autocorrelation or ordinary least squares linear regression modeling using outcome variables of asthma visits and admissions. RESULTS: There were 56, 747 visits, with 554 asthma visits and 1,514 URI visits. Asthma visits (R(2) = 0.631) were positively correlated with tree pollen counts (correlation coefficient = 0.458 [0.152-0.765]) and average humidity (correlation coefficient = 1.528 [0.296-2.760]). Asthma admissions (R(2) = 0.480) were negatively correlated with average temperature (correlation coefficient = -0.557 [-1.052 to -0.061]) when adjusting for confounding by fine particulate matter. CONCLUSIONS: The ED acute asthma exacerbation presentation is positively correlated with tree pollen and humidity, whereas need for admission is associated with dropping temperatures. These results reinforce the need for vigilance during periods of increased risk and perhaps focused preventative strategies.",

      "title": "The San Diego 2007 wildfires and Medi-Cal emergency department presentations, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits: An observational study of smoke exposure periods and a bidirectional case-crossover analysis.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The frequency and intensity of wildfires is anticipated to increase as climate change creates longer, warmer, and drier seasons. Particulate matter (PM) from wildfire smoke has been linked to adverse respiratory and possibly cardiovascular outcomes. Children, older adults, and persons with underlying respiratory and cardiovascular conditions are thought to be particularly vulnerable. This study examines the healthcare utilization of Medi-Cal recipients during the fall 2007 San Diego wildfires, which exposed millions of persons to wildfire smoke. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Respiratory and cardiovascular International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes were identified from Medi-Cal fee-for-service claims for emergency department presentations, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits. For a respiratory index and a cardiovascular index of key diagnoses and individual diagnoses, we calculated rate ratios (RRs) for the study population and different age groups for 3 consecutive 5-day exposure periods (P1 [October 22-26], P2 [October 27-31], and P3 [November 1-5]) versus pre-fire comparison periods matched on day of week (5-day periods starting 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 weeks before each exposed period). We used a bidirectional symmetric case-crossover design to examine emergency department presentations with any respiratory diagnosis and asthma specifically, with exposure based on modeled wildfire-derived fine inhalable particles that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller (PM2.5). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for temperature and relative humidity, to assess same-day and moving averages. We also evaluated the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Air Quality Index (AQI) with this conditional logistic regression method. We identified 21,353 inpatient hospitalizations, 25,922 emergency department presentations, and 297,698 outpatient visits between August 16 and December 15, 2007. During P1, total emergency department presentations were no different than the reference periods (1,071 versus 1,062.2; RR 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.08), those for respiratory diagnoses increased by 34% (288 versus 215.3; RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18-1.52), and those for asthma increased by 112% (58 versus 27.3; RR 2.12; 95% CI 1.57-2.86). Some visit types continued to be elevated in later time frames, e.g., a 72% increase in outpatient visits for acute bronchitis in P2. Among children aged 0-4, emergency department presentations for respiratory diagnoses increased by 70% in P1, and very young children (0-1) experienced a 243% increase for asthma diagnoses. Associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (72-hour moving average), we found 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.13) times greater odds of an emergency department presentation for asthma. The AQI level \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" was associated with significantly elevated odds of an emergency department presentation for respiratory conditions the day following exposure, compared to the AQI level \"good\" (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.18-2.53). Study limitations include the use of patient home address to estimate exposures and demographic differences between Medi-Cal beneficiaries and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory diagnoses, especially asthma, were elevated during the wildfires in the vulnerable population of Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Wildfire-related healthcare utilization appeared to persist beyond the initial high-exposure period. Increased adverse health events were apparent even at mildly degraded AQI levels. Significant increases in health events, especially for respiratory conditions and among young children, are expected based on projected climate scenarios of wildfire frequency in California and globally.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Fine particulate matter air pollution of 2.5 μm or less in diameter (PM2.5) has been associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease, but assessments of specific respiratory infections in adults are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the rate of respiratory infection healthcare encounters in adults associated with acute increases in PM2.5 concentrations. METHODS: Using case-crossover methods, we studied 498,118 adult New York State residents with a primary diagnosis of influenza, bacterial pneumonia, or culture-negative pneumonia upon hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit (2005-2016). We estimated the relative rate of healthcare encounters associated with increases in PM2.5 in the previous 1-7 days and explored differences before (2005-2007), during (2008-2013), and after (2014-2016) implementation of air quality policies and economic changes. RESULTS: Interquartile range increases in PM2.5 over the previous 7 days were associated with increased excess rates (ERs) of culture-negative pneumonia hospitalizations (2.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.2%) and ED visits (2.5%; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6%), and increased ERs of influenza ED visits (3.9%; 95% CI, 2.1-5.6%). Bacterial pneumonia hospitalizations, but not ED visits, were associated with increases in PM2.5 and, though imprecise, were of a similar magnitude to culture-negative pneumonia (Lag Day 6 ER, 2.3%; 95% CI, 0.3-4.3). Increased relative rates of influenza ED visits and culture-negative pneumonia hospitalizations were generally larger in the \"after\" period (P < 0.025 for both outcomes), compared with the \"during\" period, despite reductions in overall PM2.5 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Increased rates of culture-negative pneumonia and influenza were associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations during the previous week, which persisted despite reductions in PM2.5 from air quality policies and economic changes. Though unexplained, this temporal variation may reflect altered toxicity of different PM2.5 mixtures or increased pathogen virulence.",

      "abstract": "Prior studies reported that exposure to increased concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were associated with increased rates of hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, rates were examined from 2005 to 2016 using a case-crossover design to ascertain if there have been changes in the rates per unit mass exposure given substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentration and changes in its composition. PM2.5 concentrations were reduced through a combination of policies designed to improve air quality and economic drivers, including the 2008 economic recession and shifts in the relative costs of coal and natural gas. The study period was split into three periods reflecting that much of the emissions changes occurred between 2008 and 2013. Thus, the three periods were defined as: BEFORE (2005 to 2007), DURING (2008-2013), and AFTER (2014-2016). In general, the number of hospitalizations and ED visits declined with the decreased concentration of PM2.5. However, the rate of COPD hospitalizations and asthma ED visits associated with each interquartile range increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration was larger in the AFTER period than the DURING and BEFORE periods. For example, each 6.8 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 on the same day was associated with 0.4% (0.0%, 0.8%), 0.3% (-0.2%, 0.7%), and 2.7% (1.9%, 3.5) increases in the rate of asthma emergency department visits in the BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER periods, respectively, suggesting the same mass concentration of PM2.5 was more toxic in the AFTER period.",

      "abstract": "The Republic of Kosovo is a small country in the Balkans. The capital city of Pristina hosts most of its population and is situated in a mountain basin with poor air exchange, especially during winter. Domestic heating, road transport, industry and coal-fired power plants contribute to high levels of air pollution. We performed a time-series analysis on effects of particulate air pollution (PM2.5) on respiratory health of children and adolescents, using hospital admission and ambulatory visit numbers from the pediatric university clinic. From 2018 until 2020, daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 ranged between 2.41 and 161.03 µg/m³. On average, there were 6.7 ambulatory visits per day with lower numbers on weekends and during the first COVID-19 wave in 2020. An increase in PM2.5 led to an immediate increase in visit numbers that lasted over several days. Averaged over a full week, this amounted to about a 1% increase per 10 µg/m³. There were, on average, 1.7 hospital admissions per day. Two and three days after a rise in air pollution, there was also a rise in admission numbers, followed by a decline during the consecutive days. This might indicate that the wards were overstressed because of high admission numbers and restricted additional admissions.",

      "title": "Short-term effects of ambient PM",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm) is an important contribution of PM2.5 mass. However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1 measurements from air monitoring stations. METHODS: We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015-2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1 and PM2.5. RESULTS: PM1 and PM2.5 showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1-2.5 were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 μg/m3 rise in exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 at lag 0-2 days, respectively. Both PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0-14 years and 45-74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PM1 rather than PM1-2.5 contributed to PM2.5-induced risks of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and effects of PM1 and PM2.5 mainly occurred in cold season.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and hospital admissions. The chemical composition of particles varies across locations and time periods. Identifying the most harmful constituents and sources is an important health and regulatory concern. OBJECTIVES: We examined pollutant sources for associations with risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory causes. METHODS: We obtained PM2.5 filter samples for four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts and analyzed them for PM2.5 elements. Source apportionment was used to estimate daily PM2.5 contributions from sources (traffic, road dust, oil combustion, and sea salt as well as a regional source representing coal combustion and other sources). Associations between daily PM2.5 constituents and sources and risk of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations for the Medicare population (> 333,000 persons ≥ 65 years of age) were estimated with time-series analyses (August 2000-February 2004). RESULTS: PM2.5 total mass and PM2.5 road dust contribution were associated with cardiovascular hospitalizations, as were the PM2.5 constituents calcium, black carbon, vanadium, and zinc. For respiratory hospitalizations, associations were observed with PM2.5 road dust, and sea salt as well as aluminum, calcium, chlorine, black carbon, nickel, silicon, titanium, and vanadium. Effect estimates were generally robust to adjustment by co-pollutants of other constituents. An interquartile range increase in same-day PM2.5 road dust (1.71 μg/m3) was associated with a 2.11% (95% CI: 1.09, 3.15%) and 3.47% (95% CI: 2.03, 4.94%) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory admissions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest some particle sources and constituents are more harmful than others and that in this Connecticut/Massachusetts region the most harmful particles include black carbon, calcium, and road dust PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess risks and costs of hospital admission associated with short term exposure to fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) for 214 mutually exclusive disease groups. DESIGN: Time stratified, case crossover analyses with conditional logistic regressions adjusted for non-linear confounding effects of meteorological variables. SETTING: Medicare inpatient hospital claims in the United States, 2000-12 (n=95 277 169). PARTICIPANTS: All Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 or older admitted to hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of hospital admission, number of admissions, days in hospital, inpatient and post-acute care costs, and value of statistical life (that is, the economic value used to measure the cost of avoiding a death) due to the lives lost at discharge for 214 disease groups. RESULTS: Positive associations between short term exposure to PM2.5 and risk of hospital admission were found for several prevalent but rarely studied diseases, such as septicemia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and acute and unspecified renal failure. Positive associations were also found between risk of hospital admission and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolism, confirming previously published results. These associations remained consistent when restricted to days with a daily PM2.5 concentration below the WHO air quality guideline for the 24 hour average exposure to PM2.5. For the rarely studied diseases, each 1 µg/m3 increase in short term PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 2050 hospital admissions (95% confidence interval 1914 to 2187 admissions), 12 216 days in hospital (11 358 to 13 075), US$31m (£24m, €28m; $29m to $34m) in inpatient and post-acute care costs, and $2.5bn ($2.0bn to $2.9bn) in value of statistical life. For diseases with a previously known association, each 1 µg/m3 increase in short term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 3642 hospital admissions (3434 to 3851), 20 098 days in hospital (18 950 to 21 247), $69m ($65m to $73m) in inpatient and post-acute care costs, and $4.1bn ($3.5bn to $4.7bn) in value of statistical life. CONCLUSIONS: New causes and previously identified causes of hospital admission associated with short term exposure to PM2.5 were found. These associations remained even at a daily PM2.5 concentration below the WHO 24 hour guideline. Substantial economic costs were linked to a small increase in short term PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "While the effects of ambient air pollution on health have been studied extensively in many developed countries, few studies have been conducted in Vietnam, where the population is exposed to high levels of airborne particulate matter. The aim of our study was to examine the short-term effects of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 on respiratory admissions among young children in Hanoi. Data on daily admissions from the Vietnam National Hospital of Paediatrics and daily records of PM10, PM2.5, PM1 and other confounding factors as NO2, SO2, CO, O3 and temperature were collected from September 2010 to September 2011. A time-stratified case-crossover design with individual lag model was applied to evaluate the associations between particulate air pollution and respiratory admissions. Significant effects on daily hospital admissions for respiratory disease were found for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. An increase in 10μg/m3 of PM10, PM2.5 or PM1 was associated with an increase in risk of admission of 1.4%, 2.2% or 2.5% on the same day of exposure, respectively. No significant difference between the effects on males and females was found in the study. The study demonstrated that infants and young children in Hanoi are at increased risk of respiratory admissions due to the high level of airborne particles in the city's ambient air.",

      "title": "Temporal variation in association between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter and hospitalisations in older adults in the USA: a long-term time-series analysis of the US Medicare dataset.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2·5) is associated with increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality, and health risks differ by the chemical composition of PM2·5. Policies to control PM2·5 could change its chemical composition and total mass concentration, leading to change in the subsequent health impact. However, there is little ence on whether associations between PM2·5 and health exhibit temporal variation. We investigated whether risks of hospitalisations from short-term exposure to PM2·5 varied over time in the USA. METHODS: We did a time-series analysis using a national dataset comprising daily circulatory and respiratory hospitalisation rates of Medicare beneficiaries (age ≥65 years) and PM2·5 in 173 US counties from 1999 to 2016. We fitted modified quasi-Poisson models to estimate temporal trends of associations within a county, and pooled county-level estimates using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to generate an overall estimate. FINDINGS: The study included 10 559 654 circulatory and 3 027 281 respiratory hospitalisations. We identified changes in the national average association between previous-day PM2·5 and respiratory hospitalisation over time, with a U-shape that is robust under stratification, linear, and non-linear models. The change in risk of respiratory hospitalisation per 10 μg/m3 increase in previous-day PM2·5 decreased from 0·75% (95% posterior credible interval 0·05 to 1·46) in 1999 to -0·28% (-0·79 to 0·23) in 2008, and then increased to 1·44% (0·00 to 2·91) in 2016. No statistically significant temporal change was observed for associations between same-day PM2·5 and circulatory hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: Hospitalisation risk from PM2·5 changes over time and has increased over the past 7 years in study, especially in northeastern USA. The temporal trend differs by cause of hospitalisation. This study emphasises the necessity of evaluating temporal heterogeneity in health impacts of PM2·5 and suggests caution in applying association estimates to a different time period.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Relatively few studies have been conducted of the association between air pollution and emergency department (ED) visits, and most of these have been based on a small number of visits, for a limited number of health conditions and pollutants, and only daily measures of exposure and response. METHODS: A time-series analysis was conducted on nearly 400,000 ED visits to 14 hospitals in seven Canadian cities during the 1990 s and early 2000s. Associations were examined between carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5), and visits for angina/myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. Daily and 3-hourly visit counts were modeled as quasi-Poisson and analyses controlled for effects of temporal cycles, weather, day of week and holidays. RESULTS: 24-hour average concentrations of CO and NO2 lag 0 days exhibited the most consistent associations with cardiac conditions (2.1% (95% CI, 0.0-4.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2-5.0%) increase in visits for myocardial infarction/angina per 0.7 ppm CO and 18.4 ppb NO2 respectively; 3.8% (95% CI, 0.7-6.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.4%) increase in visits for heart failure). Ozone (lag 2 days) was most consistently associated with respiratory visits (3.2% (95% CI, 0.3-6.2%), and 3.7% (95% CI, -0.5-7.9%) increases in asthma and COPD visits respectively per 18.4 ppb). Associations tended to be of greater magnitude during the warm season (April - September). In particular, the associations of PM 10 and PM2.5 with asthma visits were respectively nearly three- and over fourfold larger vs. all year analyses (14.4% increase in visits, 95% CI, 0.2-30.7, per 20.6 microg/m3 PM 10 and 7.6% increase in visits, 95% CI, 5.1-10.1, per 8.2 microg/m3 PM2.5). No consistent associations were observed between three hour average pollutant concentrations and same-day three hour averages of ED visits. CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter analysis, daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 exhibited the most consistent associations with ED visits for cardiac conditions, while ozone exhibited the most consistent associations with visits for respiratory conditions. PM 10 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with asthma visits during the warm season.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We estimate the short-term associations between daily changes in ambient air pollutants and daily asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits in Indianapolis, IN. METHODS: We identified asthma-related ED visits among Indianapolis residents aged ≥5 years. We used Poisson regression in a time-series framework to estimate the increased risk for asthma-related ED visits from exposure to ambient SO2, PM2.5 and ozone during the warm season (April-September) and SO2 and PM2.5 during the cold (October-March) season, from 2007 to 2011. Our models controlled for measured confounders, including weather and respiratory infections, as well as unmeasured confounders using a natural cubic spline to account for long-term seasonal trends. RESULTS: During 2007-2011 in Indianapolis, 165,056 asthma-related ED visits occurred. We found statistically significant positive associations (p < 0.05) between ambient air pollutants and ED visits during the warm season for persons aged 5-44 years. Interquartile range increases in daily ozone concentrations with same day, 2-day lagged, and 3-day moving average were associated with increased risks for ED visits of 3.2% (95% CI: 0.2%, 6.3%), 4.4% (0.1%, 8.9%) and 4.8% (0.2%, 9.6%), respectively. Interquartile range increases in 3-day moving averages for SO2 were associated with an increased risk of 3.3% (95% CI: 0.2%, 6.5%). We identified statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) between increased SO2 and PM2.5 levels and decreased ED visits among some age groups, primarily during the cold season, and no significant positive associations between changes in PM2.5 concentration and asthma-related ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: During the warm season, increases in ozone and SO2 concentrations were associated with increased asthma morbidity in children and young adults in Indianapolis. These results will enable reliable estimation of the health impacts of increases in these pollutants on asthma-related ED visits in Indianapolis and similar communities.",

      "title": "The effects of fine particle components on respiratory hospital admissions in children.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between acute exposure to ambient fine particles and both mortality and morbidity. Less is known about the relative impacts of the specific chemical constituents of particulate matter<2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on hospital admissions. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to estimate the risks of exposure to PM2.5 and several species on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children. DATA AND METHODS: We obtained data on daily counts of hospitalizations for children<19 and <5 years of age for total respiratory diseases and several subcategories including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and asthma for six California counties from 2000 through 2003, as well as ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and its constituents, including elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and nitrates (NO3). We used Poisson regression to estimate risks while controlling for important covariates. RESULTS: We observed associations between several components of PM2.5 and hospitalization for all of the respiratory outcomes examined. For example, for total respiratory admissions for children<19 years of age, the interquartile range for a 3-day lag of PM2.5, EC, OC, NO3, and sulfates was associated with an excess risk of 4.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-6.4], 5.4% (95% CI, 0.8-10.3), 3.4% (95% CI, 1.1-5.7), 3.3% (95% CI, 1.1-5.5), and 3.0% (95% CI, 0.4-5.7), respectively. We also observed associations for several metals. Additional associations with several of the species, including potassium, were observed in the cool season. CONCLUSION: Components of PM2.5 were associated with hospitalization for several childhood respiratory diseases including pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma. Because exposure to components (e.g., EC, OC, NO3, and K) and their related sources, including diesel and gasoline exhaust, wood smoke, and other combustion sources, are ubiquitous in the urban environment, it likely represents an identifiable and preventable risk factor for hospitalization for children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although many studies have established significant associations between short-term air pollution and the risk of getting cardiovascular diseases, there is a lack of evidence based on causal distributed lag modeling. METHODS: Inverse probability weighting (ipw) propensity score models along with conditional logistic outcome regression models based on a case-crossover study design were applied to get the causal unconstrained distributed (lag0-lag5) as well as cumulative lag effect of short-term exposure to PM2.5/Ozone on hospital admissions of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) and ischemic stroke (IS) among New England Medicare participants during 2000-2012. Effect modification by gender, race, secondary diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Diabetes (DM) was explored. RESULTS: Each 10 μg/m3 increase in lag0-lag5 cumulative PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase of 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 2.2%, 6.4%, percentage change) in AMI hospital admission rate, an increase of 3.9% (2.4%, 5.5%) in CHF rate and an increase of 2.6% (0.4%, 4.7%) in IS rate. A weakened lagging effect of PM2.5 from lag0 to lag5 could be observed. No cumulative short-term effect of ozone on CVD was found. People with secondary diagnosis of COPD, diabetes, female gender and black race are sensitive population. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our causal distributed lag modeling, we found that short-term exposure to an increased ambient PM2.5 level had the potential to induce higher risk of CVD hospitalization in a causal way. More attention should be paid to population of COPD, diabetes, female gender and black race.",

      "title": "Coarse Particulate Air Pollution Associated with Increased Risk of Hospital Admissions for Respiratory Diseases in a Tropical City, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",
      "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether there was an association between coarse particles (PM₂.₅-₁₀) levels and frequency of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases (RD) in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Hospital admissions for RD including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pneumonia, and ambient air pollution data levels for Kaohsiung were obtained for the period from 2006 to 2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions for RD was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased rate of admissions for RD were significantly associated with higher coarse PM levels only on cool days (<25 °C), with a 10 µg/m³ elevation in PM₂.₅-₁₀ concentrations associated with a 3% (95% CI = 1%-5%) rise in COPD admissions, 4% (95% CI = 1%-7%) increase in asthma admissions, and 3% (95% CI = 2%-4%) rise in pneumonia admissions. No significant associations were found between coarse particle levels and the number of hospital admissions for RD on warm days. In the two-pollutant models, PM₂.₅-₁₀ levels remained significantly correlated with higher rate of RD admissions even controlling for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, or ozone on cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM₂.₅-₁₀ enhance the risk of hospital admissions for RD on cool days.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases among school-aged children in the United States. Environmental respiratory irritants exacerbate asthma among children. Understanding the impact of a variety of known and biologically plausible environmental irritants and triggers among children in New Jersey - ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tree pollen, weed pollen, grass pollen and ragweed - would allow for informed public health interventions. METHODS: Time-stratified case-crossover design was used to study the transient impact of ozone, PM2.5 and pollen on the acute onset of pediatric asthma. Daily emergency department visits were obtained for children aged 3-17 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma during the warm season (April through September), 2004-2007 (inclusive). Bi-directional control sampling was used to select two control periods for each case for a total of 65,562 inclusion days. Since the period of exposure prior to emergency department visit may be the most clinically relevant, lag exposures were investigated (same day (lag0), 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as well as 3-day and 5-day moving averages). Multivariable conditional logistic regression controlling for holiday, school-in-session indicator, and 3-day moving average for temperature and relative humidity was used to examine the associations. Odds ratios are based on interquartile range (IQR) increases or 10 unit increases when IQR ranges were narrow. Single-pollutant models as well as multipollutant models were examined. Stratification on gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status was explored. RESULTS: The associations with ozone and PM2.5 were strongest on the same day (lag0) of the emergency department visit (RR IQR=1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06) and (RR IQR=1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04), respectively, with a decreasing lag effect. Tree and weed pollen were associated with pediatric ED visits; the largest magnitudes of association was with the 5-day average (RR IQR=1.23, 95% CI 1.21-1.25) and (RR 10=1.13, 95% CI 1.12-1.14), respectively. Grass pollen was only minimally associated with the outcome while ragweed had a negative association. CONCLUSIONS: The ambient air pollutant ozone is associated with increases in pediatric emergency department asthma visits during the warm weather season. The different pollen types showed different associations with the outcome. High levels of tree pollen appear to be an important risk factor in asthma exacerbations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012, Colorado experienced one of its worst wildfire seasons of the past decade. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship of local PM2.5 levels, modeled using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry, with emergency department visits and acute hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes during the 2012 Colorado wildfires. METHODS: Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between both continuous and categorical PM2.5 and emergency department visits during the wildfire period, from June 5(th) to July 6(th) 2012. RESULTS: For respiratory outcomes, we observed positive relationships between lag 0 PM2.5 and asthma/wheeze (1 h max OR 1.01, 95 % CI (1.00, 1.01) per 10 μg/m(3); 24 h mean OR 1.04 95 % CI (1.02, 1.06) per 5 μg/m(3)), and COPD (1 h max OR 1.01 95 % CI (1.00, 1.02) per 10 μg/m(3); 24 h mean OR 1.05 95 % CI (1.02, 1.08) per 5 μg/m(3)). These associations were also positive for 2-day and 3-day moving average lag periods. When PM2.5 was modeled as a categorical variable, bronchitis also showed elevated effect estimates over the referent groups for lag 0 24 h average concentration. Cardiovascular results were consistent with no association. CONCLUSIONS: We observed positive associations between PM2.5 from wildfire and respiratory diseases, supporting evidence from previous research that wildfire PM2.5 is an important source for adverse respiratory health outcomes.",

      "title": "Influence of urbanicity and county characteristics on the association between ozone and asthma emergency department visits in North Carolina.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution epidemiologic studies, often conducted in large metropolitan areas because of proximity to regulatory monitors, are limited in their ability to examine potential associations between air pollution exposures and health effects in rural locations. METHODS: Using a time-stratified case-crossover framework, we examined associations between asthma emergency department (ED) visits in North Carolina (2006-2008), collected by a surveillance system, and short-term ozone (O3) exposures using predicted concentrations from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We estimated associations by county groupings based on four urbanicity classifications (representative of county size and urban proximity) and county health. RESULTS: O3 was associated with asthma ED visits in all-year and warm season (April-October) analyses [odds ratio (OR) = 1.019; 95% CI: 0.998, 1.040; OR = 1.020; 95% CI: 0.997, 1.044, respectively, for a 20-ppb increase in lag 0-2 days O3]. The association was strongest in Less Urbanized counties, with no evidence of a positive association in Rural counties. Associations were similar when adjusted for fine particulate matter in copollutant models. Associations were stronger for children (5-17 years of age) compared with other age groups, and for individuals living in counties identified with poorer health status compared with counties that had the highest health rankings, although estimated associations for these subgroups had larger uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between short-term O3 exposures and asthma ED visits differed by overall county health and urbanicity, with stronger associations in Less Urbanized counties, and no positive association in Rural counties. Results also suggest that children are at increased risk of O3-related respiratory effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Environmental exposure is a crucial factor contributing to the increasing health and economic burden of chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs). This study aims to quantify the effects of environmental exposure on hospitalization costs associated with CLRDs and their population heterogeneity, thus providing a scientific basis for formulating more precise and effective cost-control policies. METHODS: Hospital admission records from seven major tertiary hospitals in Changchun from 2017 to 2020 were collected, as were environmental monitoring and meteorological data. A generalized additive model and distributed lag nonlinear model were employed to identify the exposure-response relationships and lag effects of pollutants and temperature. RESULTS: A total of 23,569 patients with CLRDs were included. Most of the participants were male (50.83%) and aged 60 years and older (63.42%), with hospitalization costs accounting for 54.22 and 67.96% of total costs, respectively. When the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, or NO2 increased by 10 μg/m3, the hospitalization costs on the same day increased by 1.78, 0.87, 8.30, and 4.43%, respectively. The cumulative lag effects of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 peaked after 6 days, whereas those of PM10 peaked after 5 days. Inhalable particulate matter had a greater effect on children aged 0-14 years and those aged 60 years and older, whereas SO2 and NO2 had greater effects on those aged 15-59 years. With respect to temperature, the hospitalization costs of people aged 60 and above increased by 8.70% on low-temperature days, and the exposure response ratio from lag day 0 to lag day 5 showed a statistically significant gradual decrease. Additionally, on lag days 5 and 11, the hospitalization costs of female patients with CLRDs increased by 3.35 and 3.92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A significant association was observed between increased air pollutant concentrations and the hospitalization costs of patients with CLRDs, with heterogeneity among different populations. Specifically, the effects of SO2 and NO2 were more pronounced, particularly in the 15-59 age group. Moreover, an increase in particulate matter concentration had a greater effect on children and older population. Extreme low-temperature weather significantly affected the hospitalization costs of older population and women with CLRDs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This paper reports on the findings of a population-based study to evaluate the relationship between atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in southwestern Taiwan over a three-year period, 2008-2010. METHODS: Data on hospital admissions for COPD and PM2.5 levels were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research database (NHIRD) and the Environmental Protection Administration from 2008 to 2010, respectively. The lag structure of relative risks (RRs) of hospital admissions for COPD was estimated using a Poisson regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, the overall average hospitalization rate of COPD and mean 24-h average level of PM2.5 was 0.18% and 39.37 μg/m³, respectively. There were seasonal variations in PM2.5 concentrations in southwestern Taiwan, with higher PM2.5 concentrations in both spring (average: 48.54 μg/m³) and winter (49.96 μg/m³) than in summer (25.89 μg/m³) and autumn (33.37 μg/m³). Increased COPD admissions were significantly associated with PM2.5 in both spring (February-April) and winter (October-January), with the relative risks (RRs) for every 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 being 1.25 (95% CI = 1.22-1.27) and 1.24 (95% CI = 1.23-1.26), respectively, at a lag zero days (i.e., no lag days). Lag effects on COPD admissions were observed for PM2.5, with the elevated RRs beginning at lag zero days and larger RRs estimates tending to occur at longer lags (up to six days, i.e., lag 0-5 days). CONCLUSIONS: In general, findings reveal an association between atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and hospital admissions for COPD in southwestern Taiwan, especially during both spring and winter seasons.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of fine particulate matter emitted through biomass burning on hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in children living in Manaus, Northern Brazil. METHODS: Descriptive study with ecologic time series design carried out in Manaus from 2002 to 2009. Hospital admission data were obtained from the Unified Health System database. PM2.5 levels were estimated using aerosol remote sensing through the measurement of aerosol optical depth at a wavelength of 550 nm. Statistical methods were used in the data analysis, with Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression between variables, with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The region of Manaus showed low PM2.5 concentrations when compared to the Southern Amazonian region. Between August and November (dry period in the region), was when the highest mean levels of PM2.5, estimated between 18 to 23 µg/m3, and the largest number of fires were observed. For the rainy season, an average of 12 µg/m3, 66% lower than the dry season measurements (20.6 µg/m3) was observed. The highest rates of hospitalization were observed during the rainy season and April was the month with the highest levels at 2.51/1,000 children. A positive association between hospital admissions and relative humidity (R = 0.126; p-value = 0.005) was observed, while the association between admissions and PM2.5 was negative and statistically significant (R = -0.168; p-value = 0.003). The R 2 of the final model (Hospitalizations = 2.19*Humidity - 1.60*PM2.5 - 0.23*Precipitation) explained 84% of hospitalizations due to respiratory disease in children living in Manaus, considering the independent variables statistically significant (humidity, PM2.5, and precipitation). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in children in Manaus, were more related to weather conditions and in particular relative humidity, than to exposure to aerosols emitted by biomass burning in the Amazonian region.",

      "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in China. In this study, we estimated the short-term effects of PM on cause-specific hospitalization in Yichang, China. Daily data for PM level, meteorological factors, and hospital admissions (total hospitalization counts = 391,960) in Yichang between 2015 and 2017 were collected. We conducted a time-series study and applied a generalized additive model to evaluate the association between every 10 μg/m3 increment of PM and percent increase of hospitalization. We found positive and statistically significant associations between PM and hospital admissions for multiple outcomes, including all-cause, total respiratory, total cardiovascular diseases, and disease subcategories (hypertensive disease, coronary heart disease, stroke and the stroke subtype, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infection). Each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at Lag01 (a moving average of Lag0 to Lag1), was significantly associated with an increase of 1.31% (95% CI: 0.79%, 1.83%), 1.12% (95% CI: 0.40%, 1.84%), and 1.14% (95% CI: 0.53%, 1.75%) in hospitalizations for all-cause, CVD, and respiratory, respectively. The association for PM10 with all-cause, CVD, and respiratory admissions was similar but weaker than PM2.5. The effect on admissions persisted for up to 7 days, and peaked at Lag01. The associations between PM and all-cause hospitalizations were stronger among older individuals and in cold seasons. It is therefore important to continue implementation of emission abatement and other effective measures in Yichang and other cities in China.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:: To estimate the association between exposure to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 microns (PM2.5) and hospitalizations for pneumonia and asthma in children. METHODS:: An ecological study of time series was performed, with daily indicators of hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma in children up to 10 years of age, living in Taubaté (SP) and estimated concentrations of PM2.5, between August 2011 and July 2012. A generalized additive model of Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk, with lag zero up to five days after exposure; the single pollutant model was adjusted by the apparent temperature, as defined from the temperature and relative air humidity, seasonality and weekday. RESULTS:: The values of the relative risks for hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma were significant for lag 0 (RR=1.051, 95%CI; 1.016 to 1.088); lag 2 (RR=1.066, 95%CI: 1.023 to 1.113); lag 3 (RR=1.053, 95%CI: 1.015 to 1.092); lag 4 (RR=1.043, 95%CI: 1.004 to 1.088) and lag 5 (RR=1.061, 95%CI: 1.018 to 1.106). The increase of 5mcg/m3 in PM2.5 contributes to increase the relative risk for hospitalization from 20.3 to 38.4 percentage points; however, the reduction of 5µg/m3 in PM2.5 concentration results in 38 fewer hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS:: Exposure to PM2.5 was associated with hospitalizations for pneumonia and asthma in children younger than 10 years of age, showing the role of fine particulate matter in child health and providing subsidies for the implementation of preventive measures to decrease these outcomes.

      "abstract": "Pneumonia, one of the important causes of death in children, may be induced or aggravated by particulate matter (PM). Limited research has examined the association between PM and its constituents and pediatric pneumonia-related emergency department (ED) visits. Measurements of PM2.5, PM10, and four PM2.5 constituents, including elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), nitrate, and sulfate, were extracted from 2007 to 2010 from one core station and two satellite stations in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Furthermore, the medical records of patients under 17 years old who had visited the ED in a medical center and had a diagnosis of pneumonia were collected. We used a time-stratified, case-crossover study design to estimate the effect of PM. The single-pollutant model demonstrated interquartile range increase in PM2.5, PM10, nitrate, OC, and EC on lag 3, which increased the risk of pediatric pneumonia by 18.2% (95% confidence interval (Cl), 8.8-28.4%), 13.1% (95% CI, 5.1-21.7%), 29.7% (95% CI, 16.4-44.5%), 16.8% (95% CI, 4.6-30.4%), and 14.4% (95% Cl, 6.5-22.9%), respectively. After PM2.5, PM10, and OC were adjusted for, nitrate and EC remained significant in two-pollutant models. Subgroup analyses revealed that nitrate had a greater effect on children during the warm season (April to September, interaction p = 0.035). In conclusion, pediatric pneumonia ED visit was related to PM2.5 and its constituents. Moreover, PM2.5 constituents, nitrate and EC, were more closely associated with ED visits for pediatric pneumonia, and children seemed to be more susceptible to nitrate during the warm season.",

      "abstract": "Very few publications have compared different study designs investigating the short-term effects of air pollutants on healthcare visits and hospitalizations for respiratory tract diseases. This study describes, using two different study designs (a case-crossover design and a time-series analysis), the association of air pollutants and respiratory disease hospitalizations. The study has been conducted on 5 cities in Poland on a timeline of almost 4 years. DLNM and regression models were both used for the assessment of the short-term effects of air pollution peaks on respiratory hospitalizations. Both case-crossover and time-series studies equally revealed a positive association between air pollution peaks and hospitalization occurrences. Results were provided in the form of percentage increase of a respiratory visit/hospitalization, for each 10-μg/m3 increment in single pollutant level for both study designs. The most significant estimated % increases of hospitalizations linked to increase of 10 μg/m3 of pollutant have been recorded in general with particulate matter, with highest values for 24 h PM2.5 in Warsaw (6.4%, case-crossover; 4.5%, time series, respectively) and in Białystok (5.6%, case-crossover; 4.5%, time series, respectively). The case-crossover analysis results have shown a larger CI in comparison to the results of the time-series analysis, while the lag days were easier to identify with the case-crossover design. The trends and the overlap of the results occurring from both methods are good and show applicability of both study designs to air pollution effects on short-term hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution can have adverse health effects on asthma sufferers, but the effects vary with geographic, environmental and population characteristics. There has been no long time-series study in Australia to quantify the effects of environmental factors including pollen on asthma hospitalizations. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the seasonal impact of air pollutants and aeroallergens on the risk of asthma hospital admissions for adults and children in Adelaide, South Australia. METHODS: Data on hospital admissions, meteorological conditions, air quality and pollen counts for the period 2003-2013 were sourced. Time-series analysis and case-crossover analysis were used to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on asthma hospitalizations. For the time-series analysis, generalized log-linear quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regressions were used to assess the relationships, controlling for seasonality and long-term trends using flexible spline functions. For the case-crossover analysis, conditional logistic regression was used to compute the effect estimates with time-stratified referent selection strategies. RESULTS: A total of 36,024 asthma admissions were considered. Findings indicated that the largest effects on asthma admissions related to PM2.5 , NO2 , PM10 and pollen were found in the cool season for children (0-17 years), with the 5-day cumulative effects of 30.2% (95% CI: 13.4-49.6%), 12.5% (95% CI: 6.6-18.7%), 8.3% (95% CI: 2.5-14.4%) and 4.2% (95% CI: 2.2-6.1%) increases in risk of asthma hospital admissions per 10 unit increments, respectively. The largest effect for ozone was found in the warm season for children with the 5-day cumulative effect of an 11.7% (95% CI: 5.8-17.9%) increase in risk of asthma hospital admissions per 10 ppb increment in ozone level. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that children are more vulnerable and the associations between exposure to air pollutants and asthma hospitalizations tended to be stronger in the cool season compared to the warm season, with the exception of ozone. This study has important public health implications and provides valuable evidence for the development of policies for asthma management.",

METHOD: An ecological time-series study was developed with data on hospitalization for pneumonia among children under 10 years of age living in São José do Rio Preto, state of São Paulo, using PM2.5 concentrations estimated using a mathematical model. We used Poisson regression with a dependent variable (hospitalization) associated with PM2.5 concentrations and adjusted for effective temperature, seasonality and day of the week, with estimates of reductions in the number of hospitalizations and costs. RESULTS: 1,161 children were admitted to hospital between October 1st, 2011, and September 30th, 2013; the average concentration of PM2.5 was 18.7 µg/m3 (≈32 µg/m3 of PM10) and exposure to this pollutant was associated with hospitalization four and five days after exposure. CONCLUSION: A 10 µg/m3 decrease in concentration would imply 256 less hospital admissions and savings of approximately R$ 220,000 in a medium-sized city.",

      "title": "Using five exposure metrics to explore the association between ambient PM",
      "abstract": "Numerous studies have identified air pollutant as a primary risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the daily average levels of PM2.5 may not accurately reflect the actual exposure level due to the fluctuating air pollutant levels throughout the day and different human activity patterns. Few studies have comparatively analyzed the association between different exposure metrics of PM2.5 and COPD hospitalization. We aimed to explore the association between PM2.5 and COPD admission in Tianshui city using five different exposure metrics (a) Daily mean concentration (DailyPM2.5mean), (b) Daily hourly peak concentration (DailyPM2.5max), (c) Daily morning concentration (DailyPM2.5mor), (d) Daily evening concentration (DailyPM2.5eve) and (e) Daily excessive concentration hours (PM2.5DECH). The PM2.5DECH was defined as daily total concentration hours > 25 µg/m3. We collected daily records of COPD admission and hourly data on air pollutants and meteorological factors from Tianshui, China, 2018-2019. DailyPM2.5mean, DailyPM2.5max, DailyPM2.5mor, DailyPM2.5eve and PM2.5DECH were used as the exposure variables. A generalized additive model (GAM) based Poisson-distribution combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to quantify the association between five different exposure metrics of PM2.5 and COPD admission. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the effect modifications of gender, age, and season. The analysis revealed significant associations between five different exposure metrics of PM2.5 and COPD admission. PM2.5-related risks of COPD admission differed by five exposure metrics. An interquartile range (IQR) increment in DailyPM2.5mean at lag06, DailyPM2.5max at lag06, DailyPM2.5mor at lag04, DailyPM2.5eve at lag06 and PM2.5DECH at lag07 was associated with a 21.64%(95%CI: 7.46%, 36.68%), 12.84%(95%CI: 1.47%, 24.58%), 16.47%(95%CI: 0.96%, 33.01%), 31.54%(95%CI: 16.49%, 47.58%), and 30.37%(95%CI: 13.91%, 46.88%) increase in Tianshui's COPD admissions, respectively. Associations of COPD admission with five different exposure metrics of PM2.5 appeared to be stronger in the cold season and among the females, while we found significantly higher effects in the population < 65 years old. The five metrics of PM2.5 exposure and COPD hospitalization show an exposure-response relationship that resembles a function curve that increases monotonically. This study added evidence for increased risk of admissions associated with exposure to the five metrics of ambient PM2.5 in Tianshui City, China, and DailyPM2.5eve or PM2.5DECH may be a significant risk factor for the increased risk of COPD admission, indicating that we should focus more on the relationship between air pollution and related diseases during the evening peak hours.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the association between ambient air pollution and hospital readmissions among children with asthma, especially in low-income communities. This study examined the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants on hospital readmissions for pediatric asthma in South Texas. A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted using the hospitalization data from a children's hospital and the air pollution data, including particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2010 and 2014. A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between ambient air pollution and hospital readmissions, controlling for outdoor temperature. We identified 111 pediatric asthma patients readmitted to the hospital between 2010 and 2014. The single-pollutant models showed that PM2.5 concentration had a significant positive effect on risk for hospital readmissions (OR = 1.082, 95% CI = 1.008-1.162, p = 0.030). In the two-pollutant models, the increased risk of pediatric readmissions for asthma was significantly associated with both elevated ozone (OR = 1.023, 95% CI = 1.001-1.045, p = 0.042) and PM2.5 concentrations (OR = 1.080, 95% CI = 1.005-1.161, p = 0.036). The effects of ambient air pollutants on hospital readmissions varied by age and season. Our findings suggest that short-term (4 days) exposure to air pollutants might increase the risk of preventable hospital readmissions for pediatric asthma patients.",

The event day was defined as a day when PM exceeded the daily average environmental standard (short-term exposure) or daily average environmental standard for 2 hours (very short-term exposure). The control day was defined as the same day of the week at 1 week prior to the event day. RESULTS: Compared with control days, asthma-related hospital visits on the 24-hr event days and 2-hr event days increased by 4.10% and 3.45% for PM₁₀ and 5.66% and 3.74% for PM2.5, respectively. Asthma-related hospital visits increased from the 24-hr event day for PM₁₀ to 4 days after the event day, peaking on the third day after the event day (1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.30). Hospitalizations also increased on the third day after the event. While there was a difference in magnitude, PM2.5 exposure showed similar trends to PM₁₀ exposure. CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between short-term and very short-term PM exposure exceeding the current daily average environmental standards of Korea and asthma-related hospital visits. These results are expected to aid in establishing appropriate environmental standards and relevant policies for PM.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting children. This study assesses the associations of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with pediatric emergency department visits in the urban environment of Newark, NJ. Two study designs were utilized and evaluated for usability. METHODS: We obtained daily emergency department visits among children aged 3-17 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma during April to September for 2004-2007. Both a time-stratified case-crossover study design with bi-directional control sampling and a time-series study design were utilized. Lagged effects (1-d through 5-d lag, 3-d average, and 5-d average) of ozone and PM2.5 were explored and a dose-response analysis comparing the bottom 5th percentile of 3-d average lag ozone with each 5 percentile increase was performed. RESULTS: Associations of interquartile range increase in same-day ozone were similar between the time-series and case-crossover study designs (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12) and (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14), respectively. Similar associations were seen for 1-day lag and 3-day average lag ozone levels. PM2.5 was not associated with the outcome in either study design. Dose-response assessment indicated a statistically significant and increasing association around 50-55 ppb consistent for both study designs. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone was statistically positively associated with pediatric asthma ED visits in Newark, NJ. Our results were generally comparable across the time-series and case-crossover study designs, indicating both are useful to assess local air pollution impacts.",

      "abstract": "We examined associations between seven source-specific PM2.5 concentrations and rates of asthma and COPD hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits in New York State and compared the changes in excess rates (ERs) between pre- (2014-2016) and post-implementation (2017-2019) of the Tier 3 automobile emission controls on new vehicles policy. A modified time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression were employed to estimate the ERs of asthma and COPD hospitalizations and ED visits associated with interquartile range (IQR) increases in source-specific PM2.5 concentrations. The 7 PM2.5 sources were spark-ignition emissions (GAS), diesel (DIE), biomass burning (BB), road dust (RD), secondary nitrate (SN), secondary sulfate (SS), and pyrolyzed organic rich (OP). Residual PM2.5 (PM2.5 - specific source [e.g., GAS]), daily temperature, relative humidity, weekday, and holidays were included in the model. IQR increases in GAS, SS, RD, BB, and SN were associated with increased ERs of asthma ED visits (highest ERs: 0.5 %-3.1 %), while a negative association was observed with DIE and OP. The rate of asthma hospitalizations was associated with increased RD concentrations (ERs: 1.3 %-1.7 %). Both COPD ED visit and hospitalization rates were associated with increased OP (ERs: 2.1 %-3.4 %), and increased SS was positively associated with COPD ED visits (ER = 3.8 %). In summary, after Tier 3 implementation (2017-2019), we found lower ERs for COPD admissions associated with BB, RD, SN, and SS compared to 2014-2016. However, rates of asthma ED visits associated with source-specific PM2.5 concentrations were generally higher for all sources, except DIE, post- versus pre-implementation, requiring further research for validation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to air pollution can trigger hospital admissions for asthma in children, but it is not known which components of air pollution are most important. There are no available studies on the particular effect of ultrafine particles (UFPs) on paediatric admissions for asthma. AIM: To study whether short-term exposure to air pollution is associated with hospital admissions for asthma in children. It is hypothesised that (1) the association between asthma admissions and air pollution is stronger with UFPs than with coarse (PM10) and fine (PM2.5) particles, nitrogen oxides (NOx) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and (2) infants are more susceptible to the effects of exposure to air pollution than older children. METHOD: Daily counts of admissions for asthma in children aged 0-18 years to hospitals located within a 15 km radius of the central fixed background urban air pollution measurement station in Copenhagen between 2001 and 2008 were extracted from the Danish National Patient Registry. A time-stratified case crossover design was applied and data were analysed using conditional logistic regression to estimate the effect of air pollution on asthma admissions. RESULTS: A significant association was found between hospital admissions for asthma in children aged 0-18 years and NOx (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17), NO2 (1.10; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16), PM10 (1.07; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12) and PM2.5 (1.09; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.13); there was no association with UFPs. The association was stronger in infants than in older children for all pollutants, but no statistically significant interaction was detected. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to air pollution can trigger hospital admission for asthma in children, with infants possibly being most susceptible. These effects seemed to be mediated by larger particles and traffic-related gases, whereas UFPs showed no effect.",

METHODS: This is an ecological time series study that took place in the city of Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, in Brazil's Amazon Region, in 2005. Information on the daily levels of fine particulate matter PM2.5 was made available by the Brazilian National Institute for Spatial Research. The model included variables related to temperature, relative humidity and adjusts for seasonality and calendar effects. Poisson regression with generalized additive models was used. RESULTS: A 10 µg/m3 increase in the level of exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increases of 9.1%, 9.2% and 12.1% in hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in children for moving averages of 1, 2 and 5 days, respectively. For the dry season, the level of exposure to particulate matter was associated with increases of 11.4%, 21.6% and 22.0% in hospital admissions in children for moving averages of 1, 5 and 6 days, respectively. No significant link was noticed in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the influence of PM2.5 on hospitalizations for respiratory disease in children under 5 in the region studied.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a prevalent childhood acute illness, with 13.6 million pediatric office visits annually, often stemming from upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and affected by environmental factors like air pollution and cold seasons. METHODS: Herein, we made use of territory-wide hospitalization data to investigate the relationships between meteorological factors, air pollutants, influenza infection, and AOM for children observed from 1998 to 2019 in Hong Kong. Quasi-Poisson generalized additive model, combined with a distributed-lag non-linear model, was employed to examine the relationship between weekly AOM admissions in children and weekly influenza-like illness-positive (ILI +) rates, as well as air pollutants (i.e., oxidant gases, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter), while accounting for meteorological variations. RESULTS: There were 21,224 hospital admissions due to AOM for children aged ≤ 15 years throughout a 22-year period. The cumulative adjusted relative risks (ARR) of AOM were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.04-1.28) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97-1.18) at the 95th percentile concentration of oxidant gases (65.9 ppm) and fine particulate matter (62.2 μg/m3) respectively, with reference set to their medians of concentration. The ARRs exhibited a monotone increasing trend for all-type and type-specific ILI + rates. Setting the reference to zero, the cumulative ARRs of AOM rose to 1.42 (95% CI, 1.29-1.56) at the 95th percentile of ILI + Total rate, and to 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.11-1.27), and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.13-1.32) for ILI + A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that policy on air pollution control and influenza vaccination for children need to be implemented, which might have significant implications for preventing AOM in children.",

Our study aimed to estimate the short-term effects of particulate air pollutants on hospitalizations for three types of respiratory disease: pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma. We collected data on daily admissions for patients with each disease from the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) in Hefei, China. Daily records of air pollutants and meteorological data from January 2014 to March 2016 were also obtained. Distributed lag nonlinear models were employed in the analysis to evaluate the association between daily air pollutants and admissions. The highest effect of each pollutant on COPD hospital admission was observed with PM2.5 at lag 12 (RR = 1.068, 95% CI 1.017 to 1.121) and PM10 at lag 10 (RR = 1.031, 95% CI 1.002 to 1.060), for an increase of 10 μg/m3 in concentrations of the pollutants. The short-term effects of PM10 on asthma hospital admissions peaked at lag 12 (RR = 1.057, 95% CI 1.010 to 1.107). According to our stratified analysis, we found that the effects on COPD admission were more pronounced in the warm season than in the cold season, and the elderly (≥ 65 years) and females were more vulnerable to air pollution.",

      "title": "Emergency department visits for asthma in relation to the Air Quality Health Index: a case-crossover study in Windsor, Canada.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In this study, associations of short-term changes in ambient air pollution with emergency department (ED) visits for asthma were examined in hospitals in the area of Windsor, Ontario. Ambient air pollution quality was represented by the Air Quality Health Index(AQHI), calculated using a formula that combines the concentrations and the relative health impacts of three ambient air pollutants: ozone , nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter. METHODS: Data on ED visits were retrieved from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Only patients two years of age and older were considered. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to 6,697 ED visits for asthma for the period of April 2004 to December 2010. Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ED visits associated with increased (by one unit) levels of AQHI were calculated by applying conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Positive and statistically significant results were observed between AQHI levels and ED visits for asthma. For all patients the largest value, OR=1.17 (CI: 1.09, 1.26), was obtained for exposures lagged by 9 days in the warm season (April-September). Effects among children 2 to 14 years of age were observed for same-day exposure (lag 0), with an OR=1.11(CI: 1.01, 1.21). CONCLUSION: Exposure to ambient air pollution in Windsor increases the risk of ED visits for asthma. When the adverse effects of air pollutants are increased, patient visits to the ED depend on the patient's age. OBJECTIFS: Dans cette étude, nous avons examiné les associations entre les changements à court terme dans la pollution atmosphérique et les visites aux urgences dues à l’asthme dans les hôpitaux de la région de Windsor (Ontario). La qualité de l’air ambiant a été représentée par la cote air santé (CAS), calculée selon une formule combinant les concentrations et les effets sanitaires relatifs de trois polluants atmosphériques: l’ozone, le dioxyde d’azote et les particules fines. MÉTHODE: Les données sur les visites aux urgences ont été extraites du Système national d’information sur les soins ambulatoires. Seuls les patients âgés de deux ans et plus ont été pris en compte. Nous avons appliqué un schéma « case-crossover » stratifié dans le temps à 6 697 visites aux urgences dues à l’asthme pour la période d’avril 2004 à décembre 2010. Nous avons appliqué une régression logistique conditionnelle pour calculer les rapports de cotes (RC) et leurs intervalles de confiance (IC) à 95 % correspondants pour les visites aux urgences associées à des niveaux accrus (d’une unité) de la CAS. RÉSULTATS: Des résultats positifs et significatifs ont été observés entre les niveaux de la CAS et les visites aux urgences dues à l’asthme. Pour l’ensemble des patients, la plus grande valeur, RC=1,17 (IC: 1,09, 1,26), a été obtenue pour les expositions décalées de 9 jours durant la saison chaude (avril-septembre). Des effets chez les enfants de 2 à 14 ans ont été observés pour les expositions le jour même (0 décalage), avec un RC=1,11 (IC: 1,01, 1,21). CONCLUSION: L’exposition à la pollution atmosphérique à Windsor accroît le risque de visites aux urgences dues à l’asthme. Quand les effets indésirables des polluants atmosphériques augmentent, les visites aux urgences varient selon l’âge des patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While limited studies have evaluated the health impacts of thunderstorms and power outages (POs) separately, few have assessed their joint effects. We aimed to investigate the individual and joint effects of both thunderstorms and POs on respiratory diseases, to identify disparities by demographics, and to examine the modifications and mediations by meteorological factors and air pollution. METHODS: Distributed lag nonlinear models were used to examine exposures during three periods (i.e., days with both thunderstorms and POs, thunderstorms only, and POs only) in relation to emergency department visits for respiratory diseases (2005-2018) compared to controls (no thunderstorm/no PO) in New York State (NYS) while controlling for confounders. Interactions between thunderstorms and weather factors or air pollutants on health were assessed. The disparities by demographics and seasons and the mediative effects by particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) and relative humidity (RH) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Thunderstorms and POs were independently associated with total and six subtypes of respiratory diseases in NYS [highest risk ratio (RR) = 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.17], but the impact was stronger when they co-occurred (highest RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.70), especially during grass weed, ragweed, and tree pollen seasons. The stronger thunderstorm/PO joint effects were observed on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchitis, and asthma (lasted 0-10 d) and were higher among residents who lived in rural areas, were uninsured, were of Hispanic ethnicity, were 6-17 or over 65 years old, and during spring and summer. The number of comorbidities was significantly higher by 0.299-0.782/case. Extreme cold/heat, high RH, PM2.5, and ozone concentrations significantly modified the thunderstorm-health effect on both multiplicative and additive scales. Over 35% of the thunderstorm effects were mediated by PM2.5 and RH. CONCLUSION: Thunderstorms accompanied by POs showed the strongest respiratory effects. There were large disparities in thunderstorm-health associations by demographics. Meteorological factors and air pollution levels modified and mediated the thunderstorm-health effects. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13237.",

      "title": "Impact of air pollution on hospital admissions with a focus on respiratory diseases: a time-series multi-city analysis.",
      "abstract": "Together with the growing availability of data from electronic records from healthcare providers and healthcare systems, an assessment of associations between different environmental parameters (e.g., pollution levels and meteorological data) and hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality has become possible. This study aimed to assess the association of air pollution and hospitalizations using a large database comprising almost all hospitalizations in Poland. This time-series analysis has been conducted in five cities in Poland (Warsaw, Białystok, Bielsko-Biała, Kraków, Gdańsk) over a period of almost 4 years (2014-2017, 1255 days), covering more than 20 million of hospitalizations. The hospitalizations have been extracted from the National Health Fund registries as daily summaries. Correlation analysis and distributed lag nonlinear models have been used to investigate for statistically relevant associations of air pollutants on hospitalizations, trying by various methods to minimize potential bias from atmospheric parameters, days of the week, bank holidays, etc. A statistically significant increase of respiratory disease hospitalizations has been detected after peaks of particulate matter concentrations (particularly PM2.5, between 0.9 and 4.5% increase per 10 units of pollutant increase, and PM10, between 0.9 and 3.5% per 10 units of pollutant increase), with a typical time lag between the pollutant peak and the event of 2 to 6 days. For other pollution parameters and other types of hospitalizations (e.g., cardiovascular events, eye and skin diseases, etc.), a weaker and ununiform correlations were recorded. Ambient air pollution exposure increases are associated with a short-term increase of hospitalizations due to respiratory tract diseases. The most prominent effect was recorded with the correlation of PM2.5 and PM10. There is only weak evidence indicating that such short-term associations exist between peaks of air pollution concentrations and increased hospitalizations for other (e.g., cardiovascular) diseases. The obtained information could be used to better predict hospitalization patterns and costs for the healthcare system and perhaps trigger additional vigilance on particulate matter pollution in the cities.",

      "title": "Nonlinear effect of air pollution on adult pneumonia hospital visits in the coastal city of Qingdao, China: A time-series analysis.",
      "abstract": "Many studies have illustrated adverse effects of short-term exposure to air pollution on human health, which usually assumes a linear exposure-response (E-R) function in the delineation of health effects due to air pollution. However, nonlinearity may exist in the association between air pollutant concentrations and health outcomes such as adult pneumonia hospital visits, and there is a research gap in understanding the nonlinearity. Here, we utilized both the distributed lag model (DLM) and nonlinear model (DLNM) to compare the linear and nonlinear impacts of air pollution on adult pneumonia hospital visits in the coastal city of Qingdao, China. While both models show adverse effects of air pollutants on adult pneumonia hospital visits, the DLNM shows an attenuation of E-R curves at high concentrations. Moreover, the DLNM may reveal delayed health effects that may be missed in the DLM, e.g., ozone exposure and pneumonia hospital visits. With the stratified analysis of air pollutants on adult pneumonia hospital visits, both models consistently reveal that the influence of air pollutants is higher during the cold season than during the warm season. Nevertheless, they may behave differently in terms of other subgroups, such as age, gender and visit types. For instance, while no significant impact due to PM2.5 in any of the subgroups abovementioned emerges based on DLM, the results from DLNM indicate statistically significant impacts for the subgroups of elderly, female and emergency department (ED) visits. With respect to adjustment by two-pollutants, PM10 effect estimates for pneumonia hospital visits were the most robust in both DLM and DLNM, followed by NO2 and SO2 based on the DLNM. Considering the estimated health effects of air pollution relying on the assumed E-R functions, our results demonstrate that the traditional linear association assumptions may overlook some potential health risks.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyse the effect of daily mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (diameter <2.5 microm; PM(2.5)) on hospital admissions due to circulatory and respiratory causes among an elderly population (>75 years) in Madrid between 2003 and 2005. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological longitudinal time-series study. METHODS: The dependent variable used was the daily number of emergency hospital admissions registered at the Gregorio Marañón University Teaching Hospital. The following causes were analysed: all causes [International Classification of Diseases 9th Version (ICD-9:1-799)], respiratory causes (ICD-9: 460-519) and circulatory causes (ICD-9: 390-459). Analysis focused on subjects over 75 years of age. Daily records of mean concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), NO(x), SO(2) and O(3) in Madrid were used as independent variables. The control variables were seasonalities, trend, influenza epidemics, noise and pollen concentrations. Poisson regression models were constructed to calculate the relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR). Analyses were performed for the entire year and for the winter and summer. RESULTS: PM(2.5) was the single primary pollutant that proved statistically significant in all models. The functional relationship with hospital admissions was linear and had no threshold. Taking the year as a whole, the RRs among people over 75 years of age for an increase of 10 microg/m(3) in PM(2.5) concentrations were: 1.038 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.053] for all causes at lag 0; 1.062 (95% CI 1.036-1.089) for circulatory causes at lag 0; and 1.049 (95% CI 1.019-1.078) for respiratory causes at lag 3. The ARs were 3.6%, 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively. These risks increased in winter and no statistically significant associations were observed in summer. PM(2.5) was the only primary pollutant that showed a statistically significant association with hospital admissions among people over 75 years of age in Madrid across the study period. CONCLUSION: Measures should be implemented to reduce PM(2.5) concentrations in Madrid.",

      "abstract": "Various fractions of particulate matter have been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The purpose of our study is to analyze the associations between concentrations of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10 and their chemical constituents (soluble ions) with hospital admissions due to circulatory and respiratory diseases among the elderly in a medium-sized city in Brazil. A time series study was conducted using Poisson regression with generalized additive models adjusted for confounders. Statistically significant associations were identified between PM10 and PM2.5-10 and respiratory diseases. Risks of hospitalization increased by 23.5% (95% CI: 13.5; 34.3) and 12.8% (95% CI: 6.0; 20.0) per 10 μg/m³ of PM2.5-10 and PM10, respectively. PM2.5 exhibited a significant association with circulatory system diseases, with the risk of hospitalization increasing by 19.6% (95% CI: 6.4; 34.6) per 10 μg/m³. Regarding the chemical species; SO₄(2-), NO₃(-), NH₄⁺ and K⁺ exhibited specific patterns of risk, relative to the investigated outcomes. Overall, SO₄(2-) in PM2.5-10 and K⁺ in PM2.5 were associated with increased risk of hospital admissions due to both types of diseases. The results agree with evidence indicating that the risks for different health outcomes vary in relation to the fractions and chemical composition of PM10. Thus, PM10 speciation studies may contribute to the establishment of more selective pollution control policies.",

      "abstract": "Considerable evidence has been accumulated on serious acute health outcomes associated with short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Modifying factors of those associations, however, have been less explored and need further analyses. In this national study, we investigated whether short-term effects of PM2.5 are modified according to region, cause of mortality/hospitalization, season, age, and sex. PM2.5-related adverse health effects were estimated by an ecological time-series study, covering about 80 % of the Canadian population for 18 years (2001-2018). We estimated city-specific associations using daily averages of PM2.5 and temperature, and daily counts of hospitalizations and mortality (non-accidental all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory). National and regional associations were then estimated with a 2-stage model. We considered potential modifying factors of PM2.5-related adverse health effects, and examined linear trends in the annual associations. Nationally, PM2.5 exposure was associated with both hospitalizations and mortality, and there was evidence of differences by the modifying factors. Of the various causes, circulatory mortality and respiratory hospitalization were more attributable to PM2.5 exposure. We found regional differences for both all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality, and seasonal differences for respiratory hospitalization (warm season) and circulatory hospitalization (cold season). Circulatory mortality risk was significant for seniors and females. All-cause hospitalizations appeared to gradually decrease over time, but annual all-cause mortality remained constant at 0.6 % of the population. Adverse health effects of PM2.5 exposures may depend on not only PM2.5 concentration, but also other factors (region, cause, season, age, sex). National estimates for the baseline (age ≥ 1 year, both sexes) risk cannot be interpreted without consideration of the differences by modifying factors. Study findings can be used by seniors, women, and those who have pre-existing health conditions to make informed decisions regarding their health risks from daily exposure to ambient PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In air pollution time-series studies, the temporal pattern of the association of fine particulate matter (PM2.5; particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter) and health end points has been observed to vary by disease category. The lag pattern of PM2.5 chemical constituents has not been well investigated, largely because daily data have not been available. OBJECTIVES: We explored the lag structure for hospital admissions using daily PM2.5 chemical constituent data for 5 years in the Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study. METHODS: We measured PM2.5 constituents, including elemental carbon, organic carbon, sulfate, and nitrate, at a central residential site from 2003 through 2007 and linked these daily pollution data to daily hospital admission counts in the five-county Denver metropolitan area. Total hospital admissions and subcategories of respiratory and cardiovascular admissions were examined. We assessed the lag structure of relative risks (RRs) of hospital admissions for PM2.5 and four constituents on the same day and from 1 to 14 previous days from a constrained distributed lag model; we adjusted for temperature, humidity, longer-term temporal trends, and day of week using a generalized additive model. RESULTS: RRs were generally larger at shorter lags for total cardiovascular admissions but at longer lags for total respiratory admissions. The delayed lag pattern was particularly prominent for asthma. Elemental and organic carbon generally showed more immediate patterns, whereas sulfate and nitrate showed delayed patterns. CONCLUSION: In general, PM2.5 chemical constituents were found to have more immediate estimated effects on cardiovascular diseases and more delayed estimated effects on respiratory diseases, depending somewhat on the constituent.",

      "abstract": "Asthma affects millions of people globally and is especially concerning in populations living with poor air quality. This study examines the association of ambient outdoor air pollutants on asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits in children and adults throughout the Pittsburgh region. A time-stratified case-crossover design is used to analyze the lagged effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants, e.g., ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) on asthma-related ED visits (n = 6682). Single-, double-, and multi-pollutant models are adjusted for temperature and analyzed using conditional logistic regression. In children, all models show an association between O3 and increased ED visits at lag day 1 (OR: 1.12, 95% CI, 1.03-1.22, p < 0.05) for the double-pollutant model (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20, p < 0.01). In adults, the single-pollutant model shows associations between CO and increased ED visits at lag day 5 (OR: 1.13, 95% CI, 1.00-1.28, p < 0.05) and average lag days 0-5 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.00-1.49, p < 0.05), and for NO2 at lag day 5 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.07, p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "We developed a hybrid chemical transport model and receptor model (CTM-RM) to conduct source apportionment of both primary and secondary PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in diameter) at 36 km resolution throughout the U.S. State of Georgia for the years 2005 and 2007. This novel source apportionment model enabled us to estimate and compare associations of short-term changes in 12 PM2.5 source concentrations (agriculture, biogenic, coal, dust, fuel oil, metals, natural gas, non-road mobile diesel, non-road mobile gasoline, on-road mobile diesel, on-road mobile gasoline, and all other sources) with emergency department (ED) visits for pediatric respiratory diseases. ED visits for asthma (N = 49,651), pneumonia (N = 25,558), and acute upper respiratory infections (acute URI, N = 235,343) among patients aged ≤18 years were obtained from patient claims records. Using a case-crossover study, we estimated odds ratios per interquartile range (IQR) increase for 3-day moving average PM2.5 source concentrations using conditional logistic regression, matching on day-of-week, month, and year, and adjusting for average temperature, humidity, and holidays. We fit both single-source and multi-source models. We observed positive associations between several PM2.5 sources and ED visits for asthma, pneumonia, and acute URI. For example, for asthma, per IQR increase in the source contribution in the single-source model, odds ratios were 1.022 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.031) for dust; 1.050 (95% CI: 1.036, 1.063) for metals, and 1.091 (95% CI: 1.064, 1.119) for natural gas. These sources comprised 5.7%, 2.2%, and 6.3% of total PM2.5 mass, respectively. PM2.5 from metals and natural gas were positively associated with all three respiratory outcomes. In addition, non-road mobile diesel was positively associated with pneumonia and acute URI.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to air pollutants, usually measured by environmental agencies that are not present in all states, may be associated with respiratory admissions in children. An ecological time series study was conducted with data on hospitalizations due to selected respiratory diseases in children under 10 years of age in 2012 in the city of Cuiabá, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were estimated with a mathematical model, data on low temperatures and relative humidity were obtained from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology, and the numbers of brush burnings were obtained from the Environmental Information System. The statistical approach used the Poisson regression generalized additive model with lags of 0 to 7 days. The financial costs and increases in hospitalizations due to increments in PM2.5 were estimated. There were 565 hospitalizations (mean 1.54 admissions/day; SD = 1.52), and mean PM2.5 concentration was 15.7µg/m3 (SD = 3.2). Associations were observed between exposure and hospitalizations in the second semester at lags 2 and 3, and at lag 2 when the entire year was analyzed. An increment of 5µg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with an increase of 89 hospitalizations and costs exceeding BRL 95,000 (≈ USD 38,000) for the Brazilian Unified National Health System. Data estimated by mathematical models can be used in locations where pollutants are not monitored. Exposição a poluentes do ar, que costumam ser quantificados por agências ambientais que não estão presentes em todos os estados, pode estar associada a internações por doenças respiratórias de crianças. Foi desenvolvido um estudo ecológico de séries temporais com dados referentes às internações por algumas doenças respiratórias de crianças menores de dez anos de idade, em 2012, na cidade de Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, Brasil. Os níveis médios de material particulado fino (PM2,5) foram estimados por modelo matemático, os dados de temperatura mínima e umidade relativa do ar foram obtidos do Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, e número de focos de queimadas do Sistema de Informações Ambientais. A abordagem estatística utilizou o modelo aditivo generalizado da regressão de Poisson com defasagens de 0 a 7 dias. Foram estimados os custos financeiros e aumentos do número de internações decorrentes de elevações de PM2,5. Foram 565 internações (média de 1,54/dia; DP = 1,52) e concentração de PM2,5 de 15,7µg/m3 (DP = 3,2). Foram encontradas associações entre exposição e internações no segundo semestre, nos lags 2 e 3, e quando analisado o ano todo, no lag 2. Uma elevação de 5µg/m3 do PM2,5 implicou o aumento de 89 internações e custos acima dos R$ 95 mil para o Sistema Único de Saúde. Dados estimados por modelo matemático podem ser utilizados em locais onde não há monitoramento de poluentes.

      "title": "Effects of coarse particulate matter on emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases: a time-series analysis in Hong Kong.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many epidemiological studies have linked daily counts of hospital admissions to particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) and ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), but relatively few have investigated the relationship of hospital admissions with coarse PM (PMc; 2.5-10 μm aerodynamic diameter). OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to estimate the health effects of PMc on emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong after controlling for PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants. METHODS: We conducted a time-series analysis of associations between daily emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong from January 2000 to December 2005 and daily PM2.5 and PMc concentrations. We estimated PMc concentrations by subtracting PM2.5 from PM10 measurements. We used generalized additive models to examine the relationship between PMc (single- and multiday lagged exposures) and hospital admissions adjusted for time trends, weather conditions, influenza outbreaks, PM2.5, and gaseous pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone). RESULTS: A 10.9-μg/m(3) (interquartile range) increase in the 4-day moving average concentration of PMc was associated with a 1.94% (95% confidence interval: 1.24%, 2.64%) increase in emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases that was attenuated but still significant after controlling for PM2.5. Adjusting for gaseous pollutants and altering models assumptions had little influence on PMc effect estimates. CONCLUSION: PMc was associated with emergency hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Hong Kong independent of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants. Further research is needed to evaluate health effects of different components of PMc.",

We imputed patient Census tracts in a case-crossover analysis of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and respiratory hospitalizations in New York State (2000-2005). We observed non-significantly higher PM2.5 exposures, high accuracy of binary exposure assignment (89 to 99%), and marginally different hazard ratios (HRs) (-0.2 to 0.7%). HR differences were greater in urban versus rural areas.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions from vegetation fires can be transported over long distances and may cause significant air pollution episodes far from the fires. However, epidemiological evidence on health effects of vegetation-fire originated air pollution is limited, particularly for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We examined association between short-term exposure to long-range transported PM2.5 from vegetation fires and daily mortality due to non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes and daily hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. METHODS: Days significantly affected by smoke from vegetation fires between 2001 and 2010 were identified using air quality measurements at an urban background and a regional background monitoring station, and modelled data on surface concentrations of vegetation-fire smoke. Associations between daily PM2.5 concentration and health outcomes on i) smoke-affected days and ii) all other days (i.e. non-smoke days) were analysed using Poisson time series regression. All statistical models were adjusted for daily temperature and relative humidity, influenza, pollen, and public holidays. RESULTS: On smoke-affected days, 10µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a borderline statistically significant increase in cardiovascular mortality among total population at a lag of three days (12.4%, 95% CI -0.2% to 26.5%), and among the elderly (≥65 years) following same-day exposure (13.8%, 95% CI -0.6% to 30.4%) and at a lag of three days (11.8%, 95% CI -2.2% to 27.7%). Smoke day PM2.5 was not associated with non-accidental mortality or hospital admissions due to cardiovascular causes. However, there was an indication of a positive association with hospital admissions due to respiratory causes among the elderly, and admissions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma among the total population. In contrast, on non-smoke days PM2.5 was generally not associated with the health outcomes, apart from suggestive small positive effects on non-accidental mortality at a lag of one day among the elderly and hospital admissions due to all respiratory causes following same-day exposure among the total population. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides suggestive evidence for an association of exposure to long-range transported PM2.5 from vegetation fires with increased cardiovascular mortality, and to a lesser extent with increased hospital admissions due to respiratory causes. Hence, vegetation-fire originated air pollution may have adverse effects on public health over a distance of hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the fires.",

      "abstract": "Taiwan has undergone rapid urbanization and industrial expansion in recent years, which have significantly contributed to elevated levels of air pollution. This study examines the association between multiple air pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in selected counties and cities of Taiwan from 2015 to 2019. Using a time-stratified case-crossover approach and conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, we analysed over 2,268,048 ED visits to assess the effects of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, and SO2 on disease-specific ED visits among residents living nearby coal-fired power plant. We also assessed effects modification by age (20-29 years, 30-59 years, and ≥ 60) and sex groups (male and female). Findings reveal that exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 at lag 5 was associated with increased asthma events, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.13 (95 % CI: 1.03-1.23) for PM2.5 and 1.16 (95 % CI: 1.05-1.28) for PM10. Additionally, every 15 ppb increase in O3 was associated with increased asthma events at lag 0 (OR = 1.04, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.06). This study further demonstrates that a 1 ppb increase in NO2 was associated with increased ischemic heart disease (IHD) events at lag 1 (OR = 1.16, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.35), stroke at lag 0 (OR = 1.05, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.07), and ischemic stroke (IS) at lag 3 (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.49), respectively. These findings underscore the importance of continuous air quality monitoring to enhance the protection of sensitive populations.",

This study used a time-series design, utilizing daily cases of ED visits and gridded WS-PM2.5 concentrations, estimated by a chemical transport model and machine learning techniques, in each statistical area level 2 (SA2) in Victoria State, Australia from Jan 1, 2014 to Dec 31, 2019. A two-stage time series model was employed to assess the association between daily mean WS-PM2.5 concentration and ED visits. Health and economic burden of WS-PM2.5-related ED visits was quantified. We found that for each 1 μg/m3 increment in WS-PM2.5, the risk of ED visits for all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases increased by 0.27 % (95 % confidence interval: 0.22 %, 0.31 %), 0.45 % (0.23 %, 0.67 %) and 0.47 % (0.30 %, 0.64 %), respectively. The associations of daily ED visits with WS-PM2.5 exposure showed higher risk in the south-eastern part. Subgroup results suggested that more pronounced effects were found in population residing in urban communities than those in rural communities. The total cost of ED visits attributable to WS-PM2.5 was A$145.49 (120.24, 170.24) million, with A$17.09 (8.97, 24.65) million and A$17.74 (11.66, 23.56) million due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. Overall, short-term exposure to WS-PM2.5 was significantly associated with increased risks for cause-specific ED visits, with varied health burden of WS-PM2.5 related ED visits in SA2 communities.",

Hospital admissions for asthma and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period of 2006-2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions for asthma was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased asthma admissions were significantly associated with PM2.5 levels both on warm days (>23°C) and cool days (<23°C), with an interquartile range rise associated with a 12% (95% CI = 6-18%) and 3% (95% CI = 0-8%) elevation in admissions for asthma, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 levels remained significant for increased asthma admissions after inclusion of SO2 or O3 both on warm and cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 elevate the risk of hospital admissions for asthma in Taiwan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the short-term effects of ultrafine particles. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <or=10 microm (PM10), <or=2.5 microm (PM2.5), and ultrafine particles on emergency hospital admissions in Rome 2001-2005. We studied residents aged >or=35 years hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, lower respiratory tract infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Information was available for factors indicating vulnerability, such as age and previous admissions for COPD. Particulate matter data were collected daily at one central fixed monitor. A case-crossover analysis was performed using a time-stratified approach. We estimated percent increases in risk per 14 microg/m PM10, per 10 microg/m PM2.5, and per 9392 particles/mL. RESULTS: An immediate impact (lag 0) of PM2.5 on hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome (2.3% [95% confidence interval = 0.5% to 4.2%]) and heart failure (2.4% [0.3% to 4.5%]) was found, whereas the effect on lower respiratory tract infections (2.8% [0.5% to 5.2%]) was delayed (lag 2). Particle number concentration showed an association only with admissions for heart failure (lag 0-5; 2.4% [0.2% to 4.7%]) and COPD (lag 0; 1.6% [0.0% to 3.2%]). The effects were generally stronger in the elderly and during winter. There was no clear effect modification with previous COPD. CONCLUSIONS: We found sizeable acute health effects of fine and ultrafine particles. Although differential reliability in exposure assessment, in particular of ultrafine particles, precludes a firm conclusion, the study indicates that particulate matter of different sizes tends to have diverse outcomes, with dissimilar latency between exposure and health response.",

      "title": "Do temporal trends of associations between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM",
      "abstract": "While associations between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and risk of hospitalization are well documented and evidence suggests that such associations change over time, it is unclear whether these temporal changes exist in understudied less-urban areas or differ by sub-population. We analyzed daily time-series data of 968 continental U.S. counties for 2000-2016, with cause-specific hospitalization from Medicare claims and population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations originally estimated at 1km × 1 km from a hybrid model. Circulatory and respiratory hospitalizations were categorized based on primary diagnosis codes at discharge. Using modified Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we evaluated the temporal trend in association between PM2.5 and hospitalizations and whether disparities in this trend exist across individual-level characteristics (e.g., sex, age, race, and Medicaid eligibility as a proxy for socio-economic status) and urbanicity. Urbanicity was categorized into three levels by county-specific percentage of urban population based on urban rural delineation from the U.S. Census. In this cohort with understudied less-urban areas without regulatory monitors, we still found positive association between circulatory and respiratory hospitalization and short-term exposure to PM2.5, with higher effect estimates towards the end of study period. Consistent with current literature, we identified significant disparity in associations by race, socioeconomic status and urbanicity. We found that the percentage change in circulatory hospitalization rate per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was higher in the 2008-2016 time period compared to the 2000-2007 period by 0.33% (95% posterior credible interval 0.22, 0.44%), 0.52% (0.33, 0.69%), and 0.67% (0.53, 0.83%) for low, medium and high tertiles of urban areas, respectively. We also observed significant differences in temporal trends of associations across socioeconomic status, sex, and age, indicating a possible widening in disparity of PM2.5-related health burden. This study raises the importance of considering environmental justice issues in PM2.5-related health impacts with respect to how associations may change over time.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To assess possible effect of air quality improvements, we investigated the temporal change in hospital admissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) associated with pollutant concentrations. METHODS: We collected daily concentrations of particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5, PM10 and PMcoarse), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and admissions for AECOPD for 21 cities in Guangdong from 2013 to 2017. We examined the association of air pollution with AECOPD admissions using two-stage time-series analysis, and estimated the annual attributable fractions, numbers, and direct hospitalization costs of AECOPD admissions with principal component analysis. RESULTS: From 2013-2017, mean daily concentrations of SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 declined by nearly 40%, 30%, and 26% respectively. As the average daily 8 h O3 concentration increased considerably, the number of days exceeding WHO target (i.e.,100 μg/m³) increased from 103 in 2015-152 in 2017. For each interquartile range increase in pollutant concentration, the relative risks of AECOPD admission at lag 0-3 were 1.093 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) for PM2.5, 1.092 (95% CI 1.08-1.11) for O3, and 1.092 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) for SO2. Attributable fractions of AECOPD admission advanced by air pollution declined from 9.5% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2016, then increased to 6.0% in 2017. A similar declining trend was observed for direct AECOPD hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Declined attributable hospital admissions for AECOPD may be associated with the reduction in concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 in Guangdong, while O3 has emerged as an important risk factor. Summarizes the main finding of the work： Reduction in PM may result in declined attributable hospitalizations for AECOPD, while O3 has emerged as an important risk factor following an intervention.",

      "title": "Interactive effects of air pollutants and viral exposure on daily influenza hospital visits in Mongolia.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution is a well-documented public health hazard linked to various adverse health outcomes. While studies have shown associations between elevated levels of air pollutants and increased influenza incidence, there is a notable knowledge gap concerning the interactive effects of air pollution and viral exposure on respiratory viral infections. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the interactive effects of air pollution and viral exposure on influenza hospital visits in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. METHODS: We conducted a time-series analysis linking daily hospital visits for influenza disease (defined as ICD10 diagnosis codes J11) with ambient concentrations of air pollutants (PM1, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3) over a period of 7 years. Viral exposure for a specific geographical region was estimated based on influenza hospital visits within acute (previous day) and sub-acute (preceding 7 days) exposure windows. Covariates included long-term time trend, temperature, temperature variation, relative humidity, holiday, and raw coal ban policy. An over-dispersed generalized linear model (GLM) with a quasi-Poisson distribution was used to assess associations, exploring interactions and lag effects up to 3 days. Season-specific models and stratified analyses by sex and age were performed, with sensitivity analyses using multi-pollutant models. RESULTS: A total of 16,364 influenza hospital visits were recorded, with significantly higher rates of visits during the winter season. All six pollutants amplified the effects of viral exposure on hospital visits in cold months, while only PM1, PM2.5, and O3 showed synergistic effects in warm months. Stronger synergistic effects were observed among children under 5 years old, particularly for O3. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution significantly amplified the adverse effects of viral exposure on influenza-hospital visits, particularly among young children and during high viral exposure periods. These findings underscore the need for employing protective measures against both air pollution and viral infections.",

This is an ecological time series study that uses data on daily number of hospitalizations of children and the elderly for respiratory diseases, and estimated concentration of PM2.5. In Alta Floresta, the percentage increases in the relative risk (%RR) of hospitalization for respiratory diseases in children were significant for the whole year and for the dry season with 3-4 day lags. In the dry season these measurements reach 6% (95%CI: 1.4-10.8). The associations were significant for moving averages of 3-5 days. The %RR for the elderly was significant for the current day of the drought, with a 6.8% increase (95%CI: 0.5-13.5) for each additional 10 microg/m3 of PM2.5. No associations were verified for Tangará da Serra. The PM2.5 from the burning of biomass increased hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in children and the elderly.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to use health administrative and environmental data to quantify the effects of ambient air pollution on health service use among those with chronic diseases. We hypothesised that health service use would be higher among those with more exposure to air pollution as measured by the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI). SETTING: Health administrative data was used to quantify health service use at the primary (physician office visits) and secondary (emergency department visits, hospitalisations) level of care in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: We included individuals who resided in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2010, who were ever diagnosed with one of 11 major chronic diseases. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate ratios (RR) from Poisson regression models were used to estimate the short-term impact of incremental unit increases in AQHI, nitrogen dioxide (NO2; 10 ppb), fine particulate matter (PM2.5; 10 µg/m(3)) and ozone (O3; 10 ppb) on health services use among individuals with each disease. We adjusted for age, sex, day of the week, temperature, season, year, socioeconomic status and region of residence. RESULTS: Increases in outpatient visits ranged from 1% to 5% for every unit increase in the 10-point AQHI scale, corresponding to an increase of about 15,000 outpatient visits on a day with poor versus good air quality. The greatest increases in outpatient visits were for individuals with non-lung cancers (AQHI:RR=1.05; NO2:RR=1.14; p<0.0001) and COPD (AQHI:RR=1.05; NO2:RR=1.12; p<0.0001) and in hospitalisations, for individuals with diabetes (AQHI:RR=1.04; NO2:RR=1.07; p<0.0001) and COPD (AQHI:RR=1.03; NO2:RR=1.09; p<1.001). The impact remained 2 days after peak AQHI levels. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with chronic diseases, health service use increased with higher levels of exposure to air pollution, as measured by the AQHI. Future research would do well to measure the utility of targeted air quality advisories based on the AQHI to reduce associated health service use.",

      "abstract": "Most of the existing epidemiological studies have investigated adverse health effects of multiple air pollutants for a limited number of cities, thus the evidence of the health impacts is limited and it is challenging to compare these results because of different modeling approaches and potential publication bias. In this paper, we expand the number of Canadian cities, with the use of the most recent available health data. A multi-pollutant model in a case-crossover design is used to investigate the short-term impacts of air pollution on various health outcomes in 47 Canadian main cities, comparing three age groups (all-age, senior (age 66+), non-senior). The main findings are that a 14 ppb increase of O3 was associated with a 0.17%-2.78% (0.62%-1.46%) increase in the odds of all-age respiratory mortality (hospitalization). A 12.8 ppb increase of NO2 was associated with a 0.57%-1.47% (0.68%-1.86%) increase in the odds of all-age (non-senior) respiratory hospitalization.

      "abstract": "Few studies have investigated the acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD)-associated attributable burden under exposure to high levels of air pollution among Asians. Data on hospitalization for AECOPD, air pollution and meteorological factors from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2016 were collected in Shijiazhuang, China. We used a Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to evaluate the relative cumulative risk for a lag of 0-7 days and examined the potential effect modifications by age and sex via stratification analyses, controlling for long-term trends, seasonal patterns, meteorological factors, and other possible confounders. Then, we computed hospitalization percentages attributable to air pollutants. The AECOPD-associated relative cumulative risks for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO for a lag of 0-7 days were significantly positively correlated with hospitalization. The associations were stronger in females and retired patients. The NO2 Cum RR of AECOPD admission was the greatest. A 10μg/m3 increase in daily NO2 concentration was associated with 6.7% and 5.7% increases in COPD hospitalizations in the retired and female groups, respectively. The results showed that 13%, 9.4%, 1.7%, 9.7%, and 8.8% of AECOPD hospitalizations were attributable to exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO, respectively. If the air pollutant concentration was reduced to the 24-h average grade II levels of NAAQS of China, the AECOPD attributable percentage for PM2.5 and PM10 would decrease by 80%. The air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO were significantly relevant to AECOPD-associated hospitalization. The associations differed by individual characteristics. The retired and female populations were highly vulnerable.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Communities disproportionately burdened by adverse neighborhood-level social and structural factors may experience greater vulnerability to environmental exposures, contributing to health inequities, including adverse COVID-19. We assessed the effects of chronic air pollution on COVID-19 morbidities in NYC and examined whether these effects varied by neighborhood-level vulnerability. METHODS: We used NYC COVID-19 hospitalization records (3/1/2020-2/28/2021) and conducted analyses in the full sample and within hospital catchment. Chronic air pollution (particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), ozone (O3)) was assigned using residential ZIP Code (NYC Community Air Survey; 2009-2019). Modified Poisson regression estimated risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, ventilation, and dialysis, and Cox regression estimated risk of discharge, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. We assessed effect modification by neighborhood-level environmental vulnerability index (NEVI) tertiles. RESULTS: From March to June 2020 (within hospital catchment), adjusted estimates generally suggest greater chronic NO2, PM2.5, and BC was associated with increased risk of ARDS, pneumonia, and dialysis, and not associated with discharge and ventilation; inverse estimates found for chronic O3. Relationships between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 were generally stronger among those with greater neighborhood environmental vulnerability. For example, chronic NO2 and pneumonia's relationship was stronger in individuals within higher NEVI tertiles (T1: aRR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.02-1.25; T2: aRR: 2.11, 95%CI: 1.73-2.56; T3: aRR: 6.36, 95%CI: 4.71-8.60). DISCUSSION: Differences in neighborhood-level social and structural factors contribute to unequal health burdens associated with air pollution. Public health resources targeted toward neighborhoods with greater environmental vulnerability can encourage population-level pandemic preparedness.",

The objective of this study is to analyse the short-term impact of NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3 and temperature in heat waves on emergency hospital admissions in Spain on days when biomass combustion occurs. We conducted an ecological longitudinal time series study across the period 2013-2018. The dependent variables were emergency hospital admissions due to all causes (ICD-10: A00-R99), circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) in 9 representative Spanish provinces. The independent variables were daily mean air pollution concentrations measured at a provincial level. We also included daily maximum temperatures recorded at reference observatories in the respective provinces. Poisson generalised linear models were fitted for days with and without PM advections due to biomass burning smoke. We controlled for trends, seasonalities, the autoregressive nature of the series, Sundays and Public Holidays. Days with biomass burning smoke advections increased PM concentrations in all provinces and ozone in many of them, something that did not occur in equal measure in the case of NO2. Nevertheless, the principal impact on admissions was due to O3, followed by NO2, PM, and lastly, heat-wave temperatures. This pattern was observed for all three causes analysed. The role of PM was relegated to that of a third factor, and the role of temperature to an order of lesser magnitude than that of chemical pollution. To focus the health impacts of wildfires exclusively on the impact of PM concentrations would be to minimise their real impact on population health. It is therefore essential to implement integrated plans that take into account the joint effect of all atmospheric variables affected.",

      "abstract": "To explore the relationship between air pollution and the number of pneumonia hospitalization in a children's hospital in Changsha.  Methods: Children who have been in this hospital for the treatment of pneumonia between December 2013 and December 2015 were enrolled in this study. Based on daily meteorological data and air pollution data from December 2013 to December 2015 in Changsha, we constructed a generalized additive model to analyze the relationship between air pollution and the number of pneumonia hospitalization.  Results: During the research, the average concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 exceeded the Grade II national standards for air quality. The average concentration of SO2 exceeded the Grade I national standards. The change of all the 3 main air pollution indexes showed strong statistical relationship with the change of the number of pneumonia hospitalization (P<0.05), among which, the impact of SO2 ranked number 1, followed by PM2.5 and PM10. Effect of atmospheric pollution on the number of pneumonia boys was basically same as that in the total pneumonia children (P<0.05). The effect on girls showed no statistical relationship in both models (P>0.05).  Conclusion: The concentrations of SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 are positively correlated with pneumonia hospitalization number of children, and their effect on boys is more obvious than that in the girls. 目的：探讨大气污染与长沙市某儿童医院肺炎住院人数的关联性。方法：以长沙市某儿童医院2013年12月至2015年12月因肺炎住院者为研究对象，结合长沙市区2013年12月至2015年12月逐日气象数据及大气污染数据，利用时间序列的广义相加Poisson回归模型，探讨长沙市区大气污染与该儿童医院肺炎住院人数的关联性。结果：研究期间长沙市大气污染各指标中，PM2.5，PM10浓度均超出国家空气质量二级标准，SO2浓度超出国家一级标准；PM2.5，PM10，SO2 3种污染物浓度的改变与儿童肺炎住院人数改变的关联均有统计学意义(P<0.05)，其中SO2影响最大，PM2.5，PM10次之。大气污染对男童肺炎住院人数的影响与对总住院人数的影响基本一致(P<0.05)，对女童住院人数的影响在各模型中均无统计学意义(P>0.05)。结论：SO2，PM2.5及PM10浓度与该儿童医院肺炎住院人数呈正相关，且对男童的影响较女童大。.",

      "abstract": "Although there is growing evidence linking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospital admissions to the exposure to ambient air pollution, the effect can vary depending on the local geography, pollution type, and pollution level. The number of large-scale multicity studies remains limited in China. This study aims to assess the short-term effects of ambient air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospital admissions from 2015 to 2016, with a total of 216,159 records collected from 207 hospitals in 17 cities all over the Shandong province, east China. Generalized additive models and penalized splines were applied to study the data whilst controlling for confounding meteorological factors and long-term trends. The air pollution was analyzed with 0&ndash;6 day lag effects and the percentage change of hospital admissions was assessed for a 10-&mu;g/m³ increase in the air pollution levels. We also examined the percentage changes for different age groups and gender, respectively. The results showed that air pollution was significantly associated with adverse health outcomes and stronger effects were observed for females. The air pollution health effects were also impacted by geographical factors such that the air pollution had weaker health effects in coastal cities.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of asthma in children is a significant phenomenon in the Caribbean. Among the etiologic factors aggravating asthma in children, environmental pollution is one of the main causes. In Guadeloupe, pollution is primarily transported by Saharan dust including inhalable particles. METHODS: This study assesses, over one year (2011), the short-term effects of pollutants referred to as PM10 (PM10: particulate matter <10 µm) and PM2.5-10 (PM2.5-10: particulate matter >2.5 µm and <10 µm) contained in Saharan dust, on the visits of children aged between 5 and 15 years for asthma in the health emergency department of the main medical facility of the archipelago of Guadeloupe. A time-stratified case-crossover model was applied and the data were analysed by a conditional logistic regression for all of the children but also for sub-groups corresponding to different age classes and genders. RESULTS: The visits for asthma concerned 836 children including 514 boys and 322 girls. The Saharan dust has affected 15% of the days of the study (337 days) and involved an increase in the average daily concentrations of PM10 (49.7 µg/m3 vs. 19.2 µg/m3) and PM 2.5-10 (36.2 µg/m3 vs. 10.3 µg/m3) compared to days without dust. The excess risk percentages (IR%) for visits related to asthma in children aged between 5 and 15 years on days with dust compared to days without dust were, for PM10, ((IR %: 9.1% (CI95%, 7.1%-11.1%) versus 1.1%(CI95%, -5.9%-4.6%)) and for PM2.5-10 (IR%: 4.5%(CI95%, 2.5%-6.5%) versus 1.6% (CI95%, -1.1%-3.4%). There was no statistical difference in the IR% for periods with Saharan dust among different age group of children and between boys and girls for PM10 and PM2.5-10. CONCLUSION: The PM10 and PM2.5-10 pollutants contained in the Saharan dust increased the risk of visiting the health emergency department for children with asthma in Guadeloupe during the study period.",

      "title": "Low level air pollution and exacerbation of existing copd: a case crossover analysis.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute greatly to increased morbidity, mortality and diminished quality of life. Recent studies report moderately strong positive associations between exposures to several air pollutants and COPD-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions (HA). Studies that use clinically defined exacerbations rather than counting ED visits and HA may be more sensitive to environmental triggers like air pollution, but very few such studies exist. Participants in a COPD disease management group living in an area of low air pollution and who were followed closely for the earliest signs of an exacerbation provided an opportunity to study associations between air pollution and COPD exacerbation. METHODS: Associations between short term exposures to air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter < 2.5 microns (PM2.5), and COPD exacerbation were assessed among 168 patients residing in central Massachusetts, a region with air pollution levels well below USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Case-crossover analyses and multivariate conditional logistic regression were used to estimate associations between 7-day average concentrations of each air pollutant, as measured at central site monitors, and COPD exacerbation experienced in the patients' homes during the period 2012-2013, while controlling for temperature and self-reported influenza. RESULTS: We found that short-term exposures to SO2 were associated with an increase in COPD exacerbation risk (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI: 1.75-3.45 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM2.5. Short-term exposures to NO2 concentrations showed a weaker association, (OR = 1.17, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.30 per 1 ppb increase) after adjustment for PM2.5. An unexpectedly modest negative association was seen for short-term exposures to PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Despite living in an area with air pollution concentrations below current USEPA NAAQS, these COPD patients appeared to suffer increased risk of COPD exacerbation following short-term exposures to increased concentrations of SO2 and NO2. An unexpected negative association with PM2.5 may result from the complex air chemistry of low level PM in this region.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The study aims to investigate the short-term associations between exposure to ambient air pollution (nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter pollution-particles with diameter<2.5 µm (PM2.5) and PM10) and incidence of asthma hospital admissions among adults, in Oxford, UK. DESIGN: Retrospective time-series study. SETTING: Oxford City (postcode areas OX1-OX4), UK. PARTICIPANTS: Adult population living within the postcode areas OX1-OX4 in Oxford, UK from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Hourly NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations and meteorological data for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 were analysed and used as exposures. We used Poisson linear regression analysis to identify independent associations between air pollutant concentrations and asthma admissions rate among the adult study population, using both single (NO2, PM2.5, PM10) and multipollutant (NO2 and PM2.5, NO2 and PM10) models, where they adjustment for temperature and relative humidity. RESULTS: The overall 5-year average asthma admissions rate was 78 per 100 000 population during the study period. The annual average rate decreased to 46 per 100 000 population during 2020 (incidence rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81, p<0.001) compared to the prepandemic years (2015-2019). In single-pollutant analysis, we observed a significantly increased risk of asthma admission associated with each 1 μg/m3 increase in monthly concentrations of NO2 4% (95% CI 1.009% to 1.072%), PM2.5 3% (95% CI 1.006% to 1.052%) and PM10 1.8% (95% CI 0.999% to 1.038%). However, in the multipollutant regression model, the effect of each individual pollutant was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Ambient NO2 and PM2.5 air pollution exposure increased the risk of asthma admissions in this urban setting. Improvements in air quality during COVID-19 lockdown periods may have contributed to a substantially reduced acute asthma disease burden. Large-scale measures to improve air quality have potential to protect vulnerable people living with chronic asthma in urban areas.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we used both case-crossover and time-series analyses to assess the associations between size-fractionated particulate matter and asthma hospitalization among children 6-12 years old living in Toronto between 1981 and 1993. Specifically, we used exposures averaged over periods varying from 1 to 7 days to assess the effects of particulate matter on asthma hospitalization. We calculated estimates of the relative risk of asthma hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions (maximum and minimum temperatures, and average relative humidity) for an incremental exposure corresponding to the interquartile range in particulate matter. Both bidirectional case-crossover and time-series analyses revealed that coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5) averaged over 5-6 days was significantly associated with asthma hospitalization in both males and females. The magnitude of this effect appeared to increase with increasing number of days of exposure averaging for most models, with the relative risk estimates stabilizing at about 6 days. Using a bidirectional case-crossover analysis, the estimated relative risks were 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02, 1.28] for males and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02, 1.36) for females, for an increment of 8.4 microg/m(3) in 6-day averages of PM10-2.5. The corresponding relative risk estimates were 1.10 and 1.18, respectively, when we used time-series analysis. The effect of PM10-2.5 remained positive after adjustment for the effects of the gaseous pollutants carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). We did not find significant effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or of thoracic particulate matter (PM10) on asthma hospitalizations using either of these two analytic approaches. For the most part, relative risk estimates from the unidirectional case-crossover analysis were more pronounced compared with both bidirectional case-crossover and time-series analyses.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between particulate matter concentration (PM10 and PM2.5) and the number of emergency department visits for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a low-pollution area. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations. A generalized additive model was used to estimate the relative risk and attributable fraction (AF), adjusting for weather variables. Pollution levels on the day of the visit and the 5 preceding days were considered to assess potential delayed effects of exposure. RESULTS: A total of 2,045 patients with 5,233 emergency department visits were included. A total of 79.1% of the patients were men. The mean age was 79.5 years (SD, 10.1). The mean concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was 11.5 µg/m³ and 17.3 µg/m³, respectively. Both emergency visits and particulate matter concentrations showed a seasonalpattern. A significant association was found with exposure occurring 3 days prior (lag -3), with a 5.8% increase in visits for every 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 (AF 5.45%) and a 3.3% increase for PM10 (AF 3.15%). Men and patients older than 75 years showed greater sensitivity to exposure. The impact of particulate matter was more pronounced during the summer months. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 is associated with an increase in emergency department visits for COPD exacerbations, with a particular impact among men, patients older than 75 years, and during the summer season. OBJETIVO: Evaluar la asociación entre la concentración de material particulado (PM10 y PM2,5) y el número de consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de la enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (EPOC) en un área de baja contaminación. METODO: Estudio ecológico basado en las consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de EPOC. Se empleó un modelo aditivo generalizado para estimar el riesgo relativo y la fracción atribuible (FA), y se ajustó por variables climatológicas. Se consideraron los niveles de contaminación del día de la visita y de los 5 días previos para evaluar posibles efectos retardados de la exposición. RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 2.045 pacientes con 5.233 visitas a urgencias. El 79,1% de los pacientes eran varones. La edad media fue de 79,5 años (DE 10,1). La concentración media de PM2,5 y PM10 fue de 11,5 μg/m3 y 17,3 μg/m3 respectivamente. Tanto las visitas a urgencias como la concentración de material particulado mostraron un patrón estacional. Se encontró una asociación significativa con la exposición ocurrida en los 3 días previos (lag –3) con incremento del 5,8% en las consultas por cada aumento de 10 μg/m3 de PM2,5 (FA 5,45 %) y del 3,3 % para PM10 (FA 3,15%). Los hombres y pacientes mayores de 75 años presentaron una mayor sensibilidad a la exposición. El impacto del material particulado fue más intenso en los meses de verano. CONCLUSIONES: La exposición a PM2,5 y PM10 se asocia con un aumento de las consultas a urgencias por exacerbación de EPOC, con especial incidencia en varones, pacientes de más de 75 años y en la estación de verano.",

Averaging concentrations in space and time is commonly carried out, but little is known about how robust the estimated health effects are to different aggregation functions. A second under researched question is what impact air pollution is likely to have in the future. METHODS: We conducted a study for England between 2007 and 2011, investigating the relationship between respiratory hospital admissions and different pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2); ozone (O3); particulate matter, the latter including particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), and less than 10 micrometers (PM10); and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Bayesian Poisson regression models accounting for localised spatio-temporal autocorrelation were used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of pollution on disease risk, and for each pollutant four representative concentrations were constructed using combinations of spatial and temporal averages and maximums. The estimated RRs were then used to make projections of the numbers of likely respiratory hospital admissions in the 2050s attributable to air pollution, based on emission projections from a number of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). RESULTS: NO2 exhibited the largest association with respiratory hospital admissions out of the pollutants considered, with estimated increased risks of between 0.9 and 1.6% for a one standard deviation increase in concentrations. In the future the projected numbers of respiratory hospital admissions attributable to NO2 in the 2050s are lower than present day rates under 3 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, which is due to projected reductions in future NO2 emissions and concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: NO2 concentrations exhibit consistent substantial present-day health effects regardless of how a representative concentration is constructed in space and time. Thus as concentrations are predicted to remain above limits set by European Union Legislation until the 2030s in parts of urban England, it will remain a substantial health risk for some time.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the health burden attributable to wildfire activity increases under climate change, it is crucial to determine which subgroups face heightened vulnerability to wildfire smoke. Marginalized communities may experience disproportionate risk from overlapping individual and community vulnerability factors. We leverage recent developments in machine learning methods for high-dimensional settings to construct detailed profiles of California communities disproportionately impacted by wildfire smoke across 27 potential effect modifiers. METHODS: We used daily 2006-2019 data on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits for cardio-respiratory diseases in California. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover study design to analyze the effect of wildfire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on cardio-respiratory diseases. Then, we investigated heterogeneous effects using a generalized random forest approach, which can handle a large set of individual-level (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and area-level (e.g., poverty level, racial/ethnic segregation) factors to construct vulnerability profiles for each Air Basin, representing areas with similar meteorological and geographic conditions. RESULTS: A 10 µg/m3 increase in wildfire PM2.5 concentration (2-day moving average) was associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions and ED visits related to respiratory diseases (OR = 1.014, 95 % confidence interval = 1.012-1.016). No association was found for cardiovascular diseases. Associations between exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and respiratory diseases varied strongly by individual- (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and area-level factors (such as A/C prevalence, Black/White dissimilarity index). The importance of these effect modifiers, and vulnerability profiles, changed across Air Basins. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning can characterize the complex heterogeneity in wildfire smoke-related health impacts.",

Daily records of hospitalizations and ER visits for respiratory diseases at the 3 hospitals serving the region were examined for 9 mo, October 1, 2000-June 30, 2001. Mean PM2.5 concentrations for the four communities ranged from 11.6 to 28.1 microg/m3. Time series analysis revealed a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) between the numbers of hospitalizations and ER visits for respiratory symptoms and concentrations of PM2.5. This effect was evaluated for 0-3 lag days, directly, and for interactions with temperatures and seasonal parameters. The respiratory health of young children may be affected by 24 hr concentrations of PM2.5 < 60 microg/m3, the threshold proposed by both Israel and the United States.",

      "title": "Air pollution exposure and the burden of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections in emergency departments: a retrospective time-series study.",
      "abstract": "Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are a major public health problem and a leading cause of pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits. Approximately 81% of emergency outpatient visits in children are due to URTI, and respiratory diseases account for 12% of all deaths worldwide. Air pollution is considered an important factor contributing to the increased incidence of respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to examine the association between ambient air pollutant concentrations and the number of pediatric ED admissions for URTI. We conducted a retrospective analysis including 2,572 children admitted to the ED between 2015 and 2020 with a diagnosis of URTI. Daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx and NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were obtained from a certified environmental monitoring station. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate associations, adjusting for season, temperature, humidity, and influenza activity. The highest number of URTI-related visits was observed in winter 2019, coinciding with the peak levels of air pollutants. In univariate analyses, higher concentrations of PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, CO, and SO2 were significantly associated with increased URTI visits. After multivariable adjustment, only carbon monoxide (IRR = 1.72, p = 0.05) and sulfur dioxide remained independently associated with higher URTI incidence, while the associations for particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide were attenuated. Ozone showed a weak inverse association, likely reflecting seasonal confounding. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that air pollution is strongly associated with the frequency of pediatric URTI-related ED visits. While seasonality plays an important role, CO and SO2 appear to be key independent factors driving this association. These findings suggest that exposure to ambient CO and SO₂ may increase the risk of pediatric upper respiratory infections, highlighting the importance of air quality in the prevention of respiratory morbidity in children. What is Known: • Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are a major public health issue • Environmental exposure, particularly to ambient air pollutants, pose significant health risks What is New: • Exposure to ambient carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) may increase the risk of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections • The data suggest that improving air quality may help mitigate respiratory morbidity among children.",

      "abstract": "Various temporal metrics of daily pollution levels have been used to examine the relationships between air pollutants and acute health outcomes. However, daily metrics of the same pollutant have rarely been systematically compared within a study. In this analysis, we describe the variability of effect estimates attributable to the use of different temporal metrics of daily pollution levels. We obtained hourly measurements of ambient particulate matter (PM₂.₅), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and ozone (O₃) from air monitoring networks in 20-county Atlanta for the time period 1993-2004. For each pollutant, we created (1) a daily 1-h maximum; (2) a 24-h average; (3) a commute average; (4) a daytime average; (5) a nighttime average; and (6) a daily 8-h maximum (only for O₃). Using Poisson generalized linear models, we examined associations between daily counts of respiratory emergency department visits and the previous day's pollutant metrics. Variability was greatest across O₃ metrics, with the 8-h maximum, 1-h maximum, and daytime metrics yielding strong positive associations and the nighttime O₃ metric yielding a negative association (likely reflecting confounding by air pollutants oxidized by O₃). With the exception of daytime metric, all of the CO and NO₂ metrics were positively associated with respiratory emergency department visits. Differences in observed associations with respiratory emergency room visits among temporal metrics of the same pollutant were influenced by the diurnal patterns of the pollutant, spatial representativeness of the metrics, and correlation between each metric and copollutant concentrations. Overall, the use of metrics based on the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (for example, the use of a daily 8-h maximum O₃ as opposed to a 24-h average metric) was supported by this analysis. Comparative analysis of temporal metrics also provided insight into underlying relationships between specific air pollutants and respiratory health.",

We conducted a time-series study of unscheduled emergency admissions by specific causes in Madrid across the period 2013-2018. The independent variables were daily mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, tropospheric ozone, noise, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Relative and attributable risks were calculated using generalised linear models with a Poisson link. During the warm months, stronger associations were found between: ozone and admissions due to respiratory, circulatory and neurological causes; NO2 and admissions due to respiratory diseases; and PM and admissions due to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Heat had a greater effect on admissions due to neurological diseases. During the cold months, no association was found with any chemical air pollutant, except for NO2 and asthma-related admissions. By age, the greatest impacts were registered for PM, noise, cold and heat at ages ≥ 65 years, and for noise, NO2 and cold at ages ≤ 14 years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Climate change, experienced as extreme weather events such as heat waves can lead to poorer air quality and underscores the critical need to consider the consequences of these environmental changes on health. Changes are occurring at a rate that exceeds what the world has experienced over the last 650,000 years, yet little attention has been focused on the potentially catastrophic public health effects of climate change. METHODS: This study instituted a two-phase approach. In building capacity for an Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, the District of Columbia Department of Health first examined the availability of climate change and health data. These data were then used to assess vulnerabilities and disease burden associated with heat, air quality, and hospitalizations for asthma (N = 5,921) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (N = 2,773) during 2007-2010. A Poisson regression analysis was applied to the time series of daily counts for hospitalizations for selected age, race, and gender groups. RESULTS: Although no significant associations were found for PM2.5, PM10, or ozone with asthma-related or AMI-related hospitalizations with seasonal changes, surveillance data found disparities in hospitalizations particularly in female, African American residents for both asthma and AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Tracking Networks are critical for assessing community environmental health vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "Temuco is one of the most highly wood-smoke-polluted cities in the world. Its population in 2004 was 340,000 inhabitants with 1587 annual deaths, of which 24% were due to cardiovascular and 11% to respiratory causes. For hospital admissions, cardiovascular diseases represented 6% and respiratory diseases 13%. Emergency room visits for acute respiratory infections represented 28%. The objective of the study presented here was to determine the relationship between air pollution from particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10; mostly PM2.5, or particulate matter <2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) and health effects measured as the daily number of deaths, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits for cardiovascular, respiratory, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) diseases. The Air Pollution Health Effects European Approach (APHEA2) protocol was followed, and a multivariate Poisson regression model was fitted, controlling for trend, seasonality, and confounders for Temuco during 1998-2006. The results show that PM10 had a significant association with daily mortality and morbidity, with the elderly (population >65 yr of age) being the group that presented the greatest risk. The relative risk for respiratory causes, with an increase of 100 microg/m3 of PM10, was 1.163 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.057-1.279 for mortality, 1.137 (CI 1.096-1.178) for hospital admissions, and 1.162 for ARI (CI 1.144-1.181). There is evidence in Temuco of positive relationships between ambient particulate levels and mortality, hospital admissions, and ARI for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These results are consistent with those of comparable studies in other similar cities where wood smoke is the most important air pollution problem.",

      "abstract": "This study describes the short-term relationships between the daily levels of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and the number of doctors' house calls for asthma, upper respiratory diseases (URD) and lower respiratory diseases (LRD) in Greater Paris for the years 2000-3. Doctors' house calls are a relevant health indicator for the study of short-term health effects of air pollution. Indeed, it is potentially more sensitive than indicators such as general hospital admissions due to the severity of diseases motivating the call. In this study, time-series analysis was used. The daily numbers of doctor's house calls were adjusted for time trends, seasonal factors, day of the week, influenza, weather and pollen. Up to 15 days of lag between exposure and health effects was considered using distributed lag models. A total of about 1,760,000 doctors' house calls for all causes occurred during the study period, among which 8027 were for asthma, 52,928 for LRD and 74,845 for URD. No significant increase in risk was found between air pollution and doctors' house calls for asthma. No significant association was found between NO2 and doctors' house calls. An increase of 10 microg/m3 in the mean levels of PM10 and PM2.5 encountered during the 3 previous days was associated with an increase of 3% (0.8% and 5.3%) and 5.9% (2.9% and 9.0%) in the number of doctor's house calls for URD and LRD, respectively. Considering up to 15 days between exposure and health outcomes, effects persist until 4 days after exposure and then decrease progressively. No morbidity displacement was observed. This study shows a significant heath effect of ambient particles (PM2.5 and PM10). When compared to the RRs obtained for mortality or hospital admissions in the same area, the values of the RRs obtained in this study confirm the higher sensibility of doctor's house calls for respiratory diseases as a health indicator.",

A generalized additive model; adjusted for long-term trend, seasonality, and other potential confounders was done to quantitatively assess the influences of air pollutants on daily respiratory admissions and analyze the influences of different seasons, sexes, and age groups. The most apparent effects for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and O3 on respiratory hospitalizations were observed at lag6, and lag7, respectively, and a 10μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and O3 concentration were associated with 0.885% (95%CI: 0.414%~1.358%), 0.328% (95%CI: 0.145%~0.511%), 3.005% (95%CI: 1.689%~4.339%), 3.199% (95%CI: 0.912%~5.537%) for CO, 0.733% (95%Cl: 0.263%~1.205%) increase in respiratory admission, respectively. No remarkable association was found between NO2 and respiratory disease hospitalisation. Females and younger groups were more susceptible to air pollutant than males and elderly groups. Together, we demonstrated that the positive associations were more pronounced in the cold season than in the warm season. The findings in present study suggest that even in Lanzhou, where air quality has been improved dramatically, positive associations still exist between air pollution and daily number of total respiratory admission.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although short-term exposure to air pollutants has been linked to heightened hospital admissions for respiratory diseases (RDs), evidence regarding its association with the risk of mortality from such diseases remains scarce. We aimed to examine the impact of short-term exposure to air pollutants on RD-related mortality. METHODS: We employed a time-stratified case-crossover design to explore the impact of short-term exposure to various air pollutants (fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3)) on mortality due to RDs. Our sample comprised 15 878 RD-related deaths that occurred between 2017 and 2020 in Hefei, Anhui province. We delineated daily exposure to air pollutants using raster data corresponding to the residential addresses of the study subjects. We used conditional logistic regression to assess the relationship between pollutant exposure and the risk of mortality. To improve precision in identifying vulnerable populations, we stratified individuals by gender and age. Lastly, we used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to explore COVID-19's impact on RD mortality. RESULTS: We found that every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10, PM2.5, and CO at a lag of zero days was associated with the largest significant effect on increased mortality from RDs (excess mortality risks of 0.735%, 1.349%, and 0.160%, respectively). We observed the highest positive associations between NO2 and O3 with delays of one and two days, resulting in excess mortality risks of 1.965% and 0.861%, respectively. We obtained consistent findings through moving average concentration analysis, while our stratified analysis showed that females and the elderly exhibited a heightened susceptibility to mortality from RDs attributable to short-term exposure to pollutants. Additionally, the ITS analysis confirmed that the COVID-19 outbreak did not significantly alter the level and trend of RD deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that short-term exposure to air pollutants, excluding SO2, increases mortality rates from RDs, particularly among women and the elderly. In the context of Hefei, our findings highlight the public health imperative for reducing local residents' exposure to air pollutants, particularly through targeted protection of vulnerable populations, to minimise preventable RD mortality.",

      "title": "The short-term association between air pollution and childhood asthma hospital admissions in urban areas of Hefei City in China: A time-series study.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impacts of air pollution on asthma attacks have become a hotspot. Previous studies mainly focused on the developed countries or cities. There have been very limited studies in less-developed region to quantify the effects of air pollutants on asthma admissions in children. This study aims to assess the short-term impact of air pollutants on asthma hospital admissions for children in Hefei, China. METHODS: Poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) were applied to investigate the effects of air pollutants on daily childhood hospital admissions of asthma from 2015 to 2016, controlling for meteorological factors. Subgroup analyses by sex and age were performed. RESULTS: There were a total of 17,227 asthma admissions during 2015-2016. We found positive correlations between childhood asthma hospital visits and concentrations of NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5. Significantly, NO2 exhibited robust positive correlations with cumulative effects 1.551 (95% CI: 1.306-1.841, lag0-3 days) in single-pollutant model and 1.580 (95% CI: 1.315-1.899, lag0-3 days) in multiple-pollutant model. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollutants had adverse effects on childhood asthma. NO2 presented the greatest effect, followed by PM2.5. Results will be important for health authority and guardians to realize the severity of air pollution on the increased risk of asthma, so as to develop relevant strategies and health interventions to meet the challenges of childhood asthma and reduce air pollution.",

Hospitalization records for AECOPD (17,655), stroke (276,736) and MI (26,235) and air pollutions concentration data (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3) were collected. A generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to determine the impact of air pollutants on the relative risk (RR) of hospitalization for AECOPD, stroke, and MI. Stratified analysis for AECOPD was based on gender and age. It was based on gender, age, hypertension, and diabetes for stroke, and for MI it was based on gender, age, and coronary atherosclerosis. The lag effect for AECOPD in terms of gender analysis occurred at lag3-lag5. The hospitalization risk for stroke with hypertension due to SO2 and NO2 was greater than that of stroke without hypertension. The risk of hospitalization for stroke with hypertension as a comorbidity due to O3 was lower than without hypertension. The risk of hospitalization for MI combined with coronary atherosclerosis due to PM2.5, PM10, or NO2 was higher than that of hospitalizations for MI without coronary atherosclerosis. Air pollution increased the rate of hospitalization for AECOPD. SO2 and O3 appeared protective for stroke patients with coronary atherosclerosis. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 had no influence on total hospitalization for myocardial infarction.",

      "abstract": "As part of the Clean Air Act, Congress has directed EPA to set air quality standards to protect sensitive population groups from air pollutants in the ambient environment. People with asthma represent one such group. We undertook a study of the relation between measured ambient air pollutants in Seattle and nonelderly hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of asthma. We regressed daily hospital admissions to local hospitals for area residents from 1987 through 1994 on particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 and PM2.5, respectively); coarse particulate mass; sulfur dioxide (SO2); ozone (O3); and carbon monoxide (CO) in a Poisson regression model with control for time trends, seasonal variations, and temperature-related weather effects. With the exception of seasonally monitored O3, we supplemented incomplete pollutant measures in a multiple imputation model to create a complete time series of exposure measures. We found an estimated 4-5% increase in the rate of asthma hospital admissions associated with an interquartile range change in PM (19 microg/m3 PM(10),11.8 microg/m3 PM2.5, and 9.3 microg/m3 coarse particulate mass) lagged 1 day; relative rates were as follows: for PM10, 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.08]; for PM2.5, 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02-1.07); and for coarse particulate mass, 1.04 (95% CI = 1.01-1.07). In single-pollutant models we also found that a 6% increase in the rate of admission was associated with an interquartile range change in CO (interquartile range, 924 parts per billion; 95% CI = 1.03-1.09) at a lag of 3 days and an interquartile range change in O3 (interquartile range, 20 parts per billion; 95% CI = 1.02-1.11) at a lag of 2 days. We did not observe an association for SO2. We found PM and CO to be jointly associated with asthma admissions. We estimated the highest increase in risk in the spring and fall seasons.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between particulate air pollution and hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Beijing, and to evaluate the differences of association among different subgroups. METHODS: Hospital admissions to intertiary hospitals for AECOPD from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015 were obtained from the electronic hospitalization summary reports (HSRs).We obtained the data on air pollution during the study period from the national air pollution monitoring system. The data on meteorological variables were obtained from the Chinese meteorological bureau. A poison generalized additive model was used to assess the effects of particulate pollution on AECOPD with adjustment for the long term trend, day of week, holiday effect and meteorological variables. Subgroup analyses were also conducted by age and gender, which would help identify higher-risk groups. RESULTS: A total of 7 884 hospitalizations from 15 tertiary hospitals were recorded during the study period, and 69.3% were male patients, 37.1% were ≥80 years of age, 45.5% were 65-79 years of age, and 17.4% were younger than 65. The mean (SD) daily concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 were 77.1 (66.6) μg/m3, 111.9 (75.8) μg/m3. Every 10 μg/m3 increase in particulate pollution concentration for a lag of 4 d was associated with an increase in hospital admissions for AECOPD as follows: 0.53% (95% CI: 0.01%-1.06%, P=0.0478) of PM2.5, 0.53% (95% CI: 0.07%-1.00%, P=0.0250) of PM10, respectively. We found differences in risk for AECOPD admissions among the different subgroups. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10 exposure in the female group there was a 1.13% (95% CI: 0.19%-2.07%, P=0.018 3) increase, 1.06% (95% CI: 0.22%-1.91%, P=0.013 6) increase in admissions, respectively, while in the male group, the association was non-significant. The patients of 80 years of age and older demonstrated a higher risk of AECOPD, 1.25% (95% CI: 0.40%-2.11%, P=0.004 0) increase of PM2.5, 1.18% (95% CI: 0.42%-1.95%, P=0.002 4) increase of PM10, respectively, while other subgroups didn't find significant association. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that particulate air pollution was significantly associated with hospital admissions for AECOPD in Beijing. The susceptibility to particulate pollution varied by gender and age.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multifaceted SARS-CoV-2 interventions have modified exposure to air pollution and dynamics of respiratory diseases. Identifying the most vulnerable individuals requires effort to build a complete picture of the dynamic health effects of air pollution exposure, accounting for disparities across population subgroups. METHODS: We use generalized additive model to assess the likely changes in the hospitalisation and mortality rate as a result of exposure to PM2.5 and O3 over the course of COVID-19 pandemic. We further disaggregate the population into detailed age categories and illustrate a shifting age profile of high-risk population groups. Additionally, we apply multivariable logistic regression to integrate demographic, socioeconomic and climatic characteristics with the pollution-related excess risk. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 1,051,893 hospital admissions and 34,954 mortality for respiratory disease are recorded. The findings demonstrate a transition in the association between air pollutants and hospitalisation rates over time. For every 10 µg/m3 increase of PM2.5, the rate of hospital admission increased by 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.7%) and 1.4% (1.0-1.7%) in the pre-pandemic and dynamic zero-COVID stage, respectively. Conversely, O3-related hospitalization rate would be increased by 0.7% (0.5-0.9%) in the pre-pandemic stage but lowered to 1.7% (1.5-1.9%) in the dynamic zero-COVID stage. Further assessment indicates a shift of high-risk people from children and young adolescents to the old, primarily the elevated hospitalization rates among the old people in Lianyungang (RR: 1.53, 95%CI: 1.46, 1.60) and Nantong (RR: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.57, 1.72) relative to those for children and young adolescents. Over the course of our study period, people with underlying diseases would have 26.5% (22.8-30.3%) and 12.7% (10.8-14.6%) higher odds of having longer hospitalisation and over 6 times higher odds of deaths after hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates provide the first comprehensive evidence on the dynamic pollution-health associations throughout the pandemic. The results suggest that age and underlying diseases collectively determines the disparities of pollution-related health effect across population subgroups, underscoring the urgency to identifying the most vulnerable individuals to air pollution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe air pollution generated by forest fires is becoming an increasingly frequent public health management problem. We measured the association between forest fire smoke events and hospital emergency department (ED) attendances in Sydney from 1996-2007. METHODS: A smoke event occurred when forest fires caused the daily citywide average concentration of particulate matter (PM10 or PM2.5) to exceed the 99th percentile of the entire study period. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models adjusted for meteorology, influenza epidemics, and holidays to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ED attendances on event days compared with non-event days for all non-trauma ED attendances and selected cardiorespiratory conditions. RESULTS: The 46 validated fire smoke event days during the study period were associated with same day increases in ED attendances for all non-trauma conditions (1.03, 95% CI 1.02, 1.04), respiratory conditions (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.10), asthma (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.15, 1.30), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02, 1.24). Positive associations persisted for one to three days after the event. Ischaemic heart disease ED attendances were increased at a lag of two days (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.15) while arrhythmias had an inverse association at a lag of two days (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 0.99). In age-specific analyses, no associations present in children less than 15 years of age for any outcome, although a non-significant trend towards a positive association was seen with childhood asthma. A further association between smoke event and heart failure attendances was present for the 15-65 year age group, but not older adults at a lag of two days (OR 1.37 95% CI 1.05, 1.78). CONCLUSION: Smoke events were associated with an immediate increase in presentations for respiratory conditions and a lagged increase in attendances for ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. Respiratory impacts were either absent or considerably attenuated in those <15 years. Similar to previous studies we found inconsistent associations between fire smoke and cardiovascular diseases. Better characterisation of the spectrum of population health risks is needed to guide public heath responses to severe smoke events as this exposure becomes increasingly common with global climate change.",

Of 1277 Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire (T-CHEQ) participants, the study population included 362 children diagnosed with asthma who were followed for a mean of 13 years from birth until March 31, 2016, or loss-to-follow-up. Concentrations of PM2.5 and its components were assigned based on participants' postal codes at birth. Study outcomes included counts of asthma, asthma-related, and all-cause health services use. Poisson regression in single-, two-, and multi-pollutant models was used to estimate rate ratios (RR) per interquartile range (IQR) increase of exposures. Covariates were included in all models to further adjust for potential confounding. The adjusted RR for sulfate (SO4) and all-cause hospitalizations was statistically significant with RR = 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-3.96) in a multi-pollutant model with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). In multi-pollutant models with oxidants, the adjusted RRs for SO4 of all-cause hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits were also statistically significant with RR = 2.31 (95% CI: 1.32-4.03) and RR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.02-1.90), respectively. While unadjusted single-pollutant RRs for asthma-specific and asthma-related health services use with the SO4 component of PM2.5 were above one, none were statistically significant. This study found significant associations with exposure to SO4 in PM2.5 and all-cause acute care, chiefly for hospitalizations, in children with asthma.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma morbidity has been associated with short-term air pollution exposure. To date, most investigations have used time-series models, and it is not well understood how exposure misclassification arising from unmeasured spatial variation may impact epidemiological effect estimates. Here, we develop case-crossover models integrating temporal and spatial individual-level exposure information, toward reducing exposure misclassification in estimating associations between air pollution and child asthma exacerbations in New York City (NYC). METHODS: Air pollution data included: (a) highly spatially-resolved intra-urban concentration surfaces for ozone and co-pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), and (b) daily regulatory monitoring data. Case data included citywide hospital records for years 2005-2011 warm-season (June-August) asthma hospitalizations (n=2353) and Emergency Department (ED) visits (n=11,719) among children aged 5-17 years. Case residential locations were geocoded using a multi-step process to maximize positional accuracy and precision in near-residence exposure estimates. We used conditional logistic regression to model associations between ozone and child asthma exacerbations for lag days 0-6, adjusting for co-pollutant and temperature exposures. To evaluate the effect of increased exposure specificity through spatial air pollution information, we sequentially incorporated spatial variation into daily exposure estimates for ozone, temperature, and co-pollutants. RESULTS: Percent excess risk per 10ppb ozone exposure in spatio-temporal models were significant on lag days 1 through 5, ranging from 6.5 (95% CI: 0.2-13.1) to 13.0 (6.0-20.6) for inpatient hospitalizations, and from 2.9 (95% CI: 0.1-5.7) to 9.4 (6.3-12.7) for ED visits, with strongest associations consistently observed on lag day 2. Spatio-temporal excess risk estimates were consistently but not statistically significantly higher than temporal-only estimates on lag days 0-3. CONCLUSION: Incorporating case-level spatial exposure variation produced small, non-significant increases in excess risk estimates. Our modeling approach enables a refined understanding of potential measurement error in temporal-only versus spatio-temporal air pollution exposure assessments. As ozone generally varies over much larger spatial scales than that observed within NYC, further work is necessary to evaluate potential reductions in exposure misclassification for populations spanning wider geographic areas, and for other pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have measured the effect of short-term exposure to industrial emissions on the respiratory health of children. Here we estimate the risk of hospitalization for asthma and bronchiolitis in young children associated with their recent exposure to emissions from an aluminum smelter. We used a case-crossover design to assess the risk of hospitalization, February 1999-December 2008, in relation to short-term variation in levels of exposure among children 0-4 years old living less than 7.5 km from the smelter. The percentage of hours per day that the residence of a hospitalized child was in the shadow of winds crossing the smelter was used to estimate the effect of wind-borne emissions on case and crossover days. Community-wide pollutant exposure was estimated through daily mean and daily maximum SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations measured at a fixed monitoring site near the smelter. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regressions. The risk of same-day hospitalization for asthma or bronchiolitis increased with the percentage of hours in a day that a child's residence was downwind of the smelter. For children aged 2-4 years, the OR was 1.27 (95% CI=1.03-1.56; n=103 hospitalizations), for an interquartile range (IQR) of 21% of hours being downwind. In this age group, the OR with PM2.5 daily mean levels was slightly smaller than with the hours downwind (OR: 1.22 for an IQR of 15.7 μg/m(3), 95% CI=1.03-1.44; n=94 hospitalizations). Trends were observed between hospitalizations and levels of SO2 for children 2-4 years old. Increasing short-term exposure to emissions from a Quebec aluminum smelter was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for asthma and bronchiolitis in young children who live nearby. Estimating exposure through records of wind direction allows for the integration of exposure to all pollutants carried from the smelter stack.",

Using the Poisson regression model and environmental valuation method, this study estimated the health risks and impaired values of Beijing residents in a consecutive high-level PM2.5 exposure during the heavy haze pollution occurred from January 10th to 15th, 2013. The results show that, substantial health risks due to PM2.5 air pollution were occurred in six pollution days, including 201 cases of premature deaths, 1,056 and 545 cases of hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, 7,094 and 16,881 cases of pediatric and internal outpatients each, 10,132 cases of acute bronchitis and 7643 cases of asthma respectively. Correspondingly, approximate 489 (95% CI: 204-749) million RMB health-related economic loss was evaluated, of which more than 90% was attributable to premature deaths, acute bronchitis and asthma. It is recommended that health risks and economic losses can be reduced through early health warning and timely medical intervention for various groups of people with different health endpoints.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this article is to examine differences in the effect of ambient particulate matter on first, second, and overall hospital admissions for respiratory disease among the elderly. We studied 8989 adults 65 yr of age or older living in the greater Vancouver area who were admitted to hospital for any acute respiratory disease (ICD-9 codes 460-519) between June 1, 1995, and March 31, 1999. Time-series analysis was used to evaluate the association between respiratory admissions and daily measures of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM10 - 2.5) in urban air, after adjustment for gaseous copollutants (CO, O3, NO2, and SO2) and meteorological variables. Repeated admissions for respiratory disease were common among the elderly. Approximately 30% of the subjects were readmitted to hospital after the first admission; 9% had more than 2 admissions for respiratory disease during the 4-yr study period. PM10 - 2.5 was significantly associated with the second and overall admissions for respiratory disease, but not with the first admission. The adjusted relative risks for an increment of 4.2 microg/m(3) in -day average PM10 - 2.5 concentrations were 1.03 (95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.09) for the first admission, 1.22 (1.10-1.36) for the second admission, and 1.06 (1.02, 1.11) for overall admissions. There was no significant association between PM2.5 and hospital admissions for respiratory disease among the elderly. Our data suggest that (1) people with a history of respiratory admissions are at a higher risk of respiratory disease in relation to particulate air pollution in urban areas, (2) analyses based on overall rather than repeated hospital admissions lead to lower estimates of the risk of respiratory disease associated with particulate air pollution, and (3) PM10 - 2.5 has a larger effect on respiratory admissions than PM2.5.",

      "title": "Influence of fire characteristics on the associations between smoke PM",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildland fire smoke is a significant source of PM2.5 pollution in the western United States, with varying chemical composition and toxicity depending on fire characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed emergency department and urgent care visits in the Reno/Sparks, Nevada region during fire seasons (July-September) from 2012 to 2019. Wildland fire smoke PM2.5 concentrations were determined using a novel approach that combined EPA monitor data, atmospheric dispersion modeling, fire emissions inventories, and Bayesian time-series modeling to estimate daily fire-specific smoke PM2.5 concentrations. Distributed lag models were used to estimate associations between total smoke PM2.5 concentrations, as well as smoke PM2.5 concentrations classified by fire intensity and fuel type, and daily counts of 11 cardiorespiratory visit outcome groups. RESULTS: We observed positive lag-specific associations between total smoke PM2.5 concentrations (per 10 µg/m3 increase) and visits for asthma exacerbation (Lag 0 RR: 1.040; 95 %CI: 1.006, 1.075), cardiovascular disease (Lag 3 RR: 1.015; 95 % CI: 0.999, 1.032), and cardiac dysrhythmia (Lag 3 RR: 1.029; 95 % CI:1.012, 1.047). Elevated cumulative associations were also observed between total smoke PM2.5 and asthma exacerbation (Lag 0-4 RR: 1.066; 95 % CI: 1.005, 1.131), unspecified respiratory disorder (Lag 0-6 RR: 1.046; 95 % CI 0.993, 1.103), and dysrhythmia (Lag 0-5 RR: 1.072; 95 % CI: 1.018, 1.129). Visits for asthma exacerbation and unspecified respiratory disorder were more strongly associated with smoke from high intensity fires, whereas visits for dysrhythmia were more associated with smoke from low intensity fires. By fuel type, forest fire smoke was most strongly associated with increased asthma exacerbation, and visits for dysrhythmia were most strongly associated with smoke from shrub/scrub fires. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence that wildland fire intensity and fuel type may influence the relationship between smoke exposure and specific health outcomes, with implications for public health messaging and land management strategies.",

      "abstract": "The current air quality indices have been criticized for not capturing combined health effects of multiple air pollutants. We proposed an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) based on the air pollution-mortality associations for communicating health risks of air pollution. Time-series studies were conducted to estimate the associations between air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), suspended particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and mortality in Guangzhou from 2012 to 2015. The sum of excess mortality risk was calculated to construct the AQHI, which was then adjusted to an arbitrary scale. We then assessed the validity of AQHI. An interquartile increase (IQR) of AQHI was associated with 3.61% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.85%-4.37%], 3.73% (95%CI, 2.18%-5.27%) and 4.19% (95%CI, 2.87%-5.52%) increase of mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, respectively. Compared with the currently used Air Quality Index (AQI), AQHI had higher effects on mortality and morbidity. Our study suggests that AQHI might comprehensively capture the combined effects of air pollution, which make it be a more valid communication tool of air pollution-related health risk.",

      "abstract": "A case-crossover study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between daily air pollutant concentrations and daily hospitalizations for selected disease categories in Perth, Western Australia. Daily measurements of particles (measured by nephelometry and PM2.5), photochemical oxidants (measured as ozone), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were obtained from 1992 to 1998 via a metropolitan network of monitoring stations. Daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using monitored data, modelling and interpolation. Hospital morbidity data for respiratory, cardiovascular (CVD), gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) excluding asthma; pneumonia/influenza diseases; and asthma were obtained and categorized into all ages, less than 15 years and greater than 65 years. Gastrointestinal morbidity was used as a control disease. The data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The results showed a small number of significant associations for daily changes in particle concentrations, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide for the respiratory diseases, CODP, pneumonia, asthma and CVD hospitalizations. Changes in ozone concentrations were not significantly associated with any disease outcomes. These data provide useful information on the potential health impacts of air pollution in an airshed with very low sulphur dioxide concentrations and lower nitrogen dioxide concentrations commonly found in many other cities.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-crossover study design was used to explore associations between fine PM (PM2.5, particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) and 10,457 AF hospitalizations from 1993 to 2008 of patients who lived on Utah’s Wasatch Front. Patients were hospitalized at Intermountain Healthcare facilities with a primary diagnosis of AF. Concurrent day exposure and cumulative lagged exposures for up to 21 days were explored and the data were stratified by sex, age, and previous or subsequent admission for myocardial infarction. Although the estimated associations between PM2.5 and AF hospitalizations for the various lag structures and strata were consistently positive suggestive of risk, they were not statistically significant and they were extremely small compared to previously observed associations with ischemic heart disease events and heart failure hospitalizations. Further, we observed no additive risk between PM2.5 and AF hospitalization in those with respiratory disease or sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previously observed associations with ischemic heart disease events and heart failure hospitalizations using similar study design and approaches, this study found that hospitalization for AF was not significantly associated with elevations in short-term exposure to fine PM air pollution.",

      "abstract": "Recently, attention has focused on whether particulate air pollution is a specific trigger of myocardial infarction (MI). The results of several studies of single locations assessing the effects of ambient particular matter on the risk of MI have been disparate. We used a multicity case-crossover study to examine risk of emergency hospitalization associated with fine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 10 microm (PM10) for > 300,000 MIs during 1985-1999 among elderly residents of 21 U.S. cities. We used time-stratified controls matched on day of the week or on temperature to detect possible residual confounding by weather. Overall, we found a 0.65% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-1.0%] increased risk of hospitalization for MI per 10 microg/m3 increase in ambient PM10 concentration. Matching on apparent temperature yielded a 0.64% increase in risk (95% CI, 0.1-1.2%). We found that the effect size for PM10 doubled for subjects with a previous admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a weaker indication of a larger effect on males but no evidence of effect modification by age or the other diagnoses. We also found that the shape of the exposure-response relationship between MI hospitalizations and PM10 is almost linear, but with a steeper slope at levels of PM10 < 50 microg/m3. We conclude that increased concentrations of ambient PM10 are associated with increased risk of MI among the elderly.",

      "abstract": "The combined impact of nonoptimal temperatures and air pollution on hospitalizations remains understudied. This study investigated how major criterion air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) modified the short-term temperature-hospitalization associations and quantified the excess attributable burden. Daily time-series data of emergency hospitalizations and environmental exposures (2000-19) in Hong Kong were analyzed using two comparative models with product terms (1) between temperature and lower and higher strata for pollutants, and (2) between temperature and the count of elevated pollutants. Over 10 million noncancer nonexternal (NCNE) admissions occurred, including ∼14% circulatory and ∼20% respiratory admissions. PM2.5 consistently amplified temperature effects, leading to 1.5-2.6% significantly higher NCNE risks with low and high temperatures and 2.8-3.7% higher circulatory risks with low temperatures. NO2 also intensified circulatory risks. Temperature effects were 1.4-2.6% higher on polluted days (≥1 elevated pollutants) than on unpolluted days (0 elevated pollutants), with positive linear trends as pollutant counts increased (p-trend <0.05). The observed temperature-attributable numbers (fraction, %) without considering pollution modification were 68,032 (0.7%), 44,290 (3.2%), and 39,995 (2.0%) for NCNE, circulatory, and respiratory admissions, respectively. These could be reduced by 0.5-0.8% in counterfactual low-pollution scenarios. Combined air pollution exposure exacerbates temperature-related hospitalization risks in Hong Kong, particularly for NCNE and circulatory admissions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In time-series studies of the health effects of urban air pollutants, decisions must be made about how to characterize pollutant levels within the airshed. METHODS: Emergency department visits for pediatric asthma exacerbations were collected from Atlanta hospitals. Concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and the PM2.5 components elemental carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate were obtained from networks of ambient air quality monitors. For each pollutant we created three different daily metrics. For one metric we used the measurements from a centrally-located monitor; for the second we averaged measurements across the network of monitors; and for the third we estimated the population-weighted average concentration using an isotropic spatial model. Rate ratios for each of the metrics were estimated from time-series models. RESULTS: For pollutants with relatively homogeneous spatial distributions we observed only small differences in the rate ratio across the three metrics. Conversely, for spatially heterogeneous pollutants we observed larger differences in the rate ratios. For a given pollutant, the strength of evidence for an association (i.e., chi-square statistics) tended to be similar across metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the chi-square statistics were similar across the metrics, the differences in the rate ratios for the spatially heterogeneous pollutants may seem like a relatively small issue. However, these differences are important for health benefits analyses, where results from epidemiological studies on the health effects of pollutants (per unit change in concentration) are used to predict the health impacts of a reduction in pollutant concentrations. We discuss the relative merits of the different metrics as they pertain to time-series studies and health benefits analyses.",

The authors conducted an ecological time series study of hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in children and the elderly in relation to daily air pollution levels, using generalized additive Poisson regression models. All air pollutants except ozone showed a statistically significant association with admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. An increase of 10 microg/m3 in fine particulate matter was associated with a 4.6% increase in asthma admissions in children and a 4.3% increase in admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 1.5% for ischemic heart disease in the elderly. These associations are consistent with a large body of literature in this area and indicate that the current air pollution levels in São Paulo have an important negative impact on the population's health.",

The Corrected Human Capital Method was used to evaluate the economic loss from premature death. The cost of illness was used to assess the economic loss of hospitalization, illness and clinic. The results show that the economic loss in the study period (2014, 2015, 2016) caused by PM2.5 was about 33.523 billion yuan (95% CI: 24.961-36.975), 21.105 billion yuan (95% CI: 13.560-26.880), and 37.132 billion yuan (95% CI: 27.246-41.164). The proportions of GDP were as follows: 6.10% (4.54%-6.73%), 3.64% (2.34%-4.63%), and 5.91% (4.34%-6.55%) for each of the three years. The health economic loss was positively correlated with the average PM2.5 concentration in winter. PM2.5 pollutants have a significant impact on the health of residents in Xi'an. The number of reported cases was about 1071338 (95% CI: 646432-1385847), 438273 (95% CI: 246842-599989), and 1019503 (95% CI: 611407-1324547) for each of the three years. The effects on children with asthma were significantly higher than that on adults, while adults with chronic bronchitis were affected more significantly than children. This study can provide a scientific basis for cost-benefit analysis of the PM2.5 air quality standard in Xi'an, and provide a reference for the management of environment quality.",

We estimated the associations between early-life short-term PM2.5 exposure and the risk of asthma or wheeze clinical encounters among Massachusetts children in the innovative Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) cohort data linkage system. METHODS: We used a semi-bidirectional case-crossover study design with short-term exposure lags for asthma exacerbation using data from the PELL system. Cases included children up to 9 years of age who had a hospitalization, observational stay, or emergency department visit for asthma or wheeze between January 2001 and September 2009 (n = 33,387). Daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated at a 4-km resolution using satellite remote sensing, land use, and meteorological data. We applied conditional logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also stratified by potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: The median PM2.5 concentration among participants was 7.8 μg/m3 with an interquartile range of 5.9 μg/m3. Overall, associations between PM2.5 exposure and asthma clinical encounters among children at lags 0, 1 and 2 were close to the null value of OR = 1.0. Evidence of effect modification was observed by birthweight for lags 0, 1 and 2 (p < 0.05), and season of clinical encounter for lags 0 and 1 (p < 0.05). Children with low birthweight (LBW) (< 2500 g) had increased odds of having an asthma clinical encounter due to higher PM2.5 exposure for lag 1 (OR: 1.08 per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.15). CONCLUSION: Asthma or wheeze exacerbations among LBW children were associated with short-term increases in PM2.5 concentrations at low levels in Massachusetts.",

Fewer studies have focused on cities that are slightly polluted. Shenzhen used to have a favorable air environment, but its air quality has deteriorated gradually as a result of development in recent years. So far, no systematic investigations have been conducted on the adverse effects of air pollution on public health in Shenzhen. This research has applied a time series analysis model to study the possible association between different types of air pollution and respiratory hospital admission in Shenzhen in 2013. Respiratory hospital admission was divided into two categories for comparison analysis among various population groups: acute upper respiratory infection and acute lower respiratory infection. The results showed that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution was significantly associated with acute respiratory infection hospital admission in Shenzhen in 2013. Children under 14 years old were the main susceptible population of acute respiratory infection due to air pollution. PM10, PM2.5 and NO₂ were the primary air pollutants threatening respiratory health in Shenzhen. Though air pollution level is generally relatively low in Shenzhen, it will benefit public health to control the pollution of particulate matter as well as other gaseous pollutants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying and characterizing how mixtures of exposures are associated with health endpoints is challenging. We demonstrate how classification and regression trees can be used to generate hypotheses regarding joint effects from exposure mixtures. METHODS: We illustrate the approach by investigating the joint effects of CO, NO2, O3, and PM2.5 on emergency department visits for pediatric asthma in Atlanta, Georgia. Pollutant concentrations were categorized as quartiles. Days when all pollutants were in the lowest quartile were held out as the referent group (n = 131) and the remaining 3,879 days were used to estimate the regression tree. Pollutants were parameterized as dichotomous variables representing each ordinal split of the quartiles (e.g. comparing CO quartile 1 vs. CO quartiles 2-4) and considered one at a time in a Poisson case-crossover model with control for confounding. The pollutant-split resulting in the smallest P-value was selected as the first split and the dataset was partitioned accordingly. This process repeated for each subset of the data until the P-values for the remaining splits were not below a given alpha, resulting in the formation of a \"terminal node\". We used the case-crossover model to estimate the adjusted risk ratio for each terminal node compared to the referent group, as well as the likelihood ratio test for the inclusion of the terminal nodes in the final model. RESULTS: The largest risk ratio corresponded to days when PM2.5 was in the highest quartile and NO2 was in the lowest two quartiles (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.16). A simultaneous Wald test for the inclusion of all terminal nodes in the model was significant, with a chi-square statistic of 34.3 (p = 0.001, with 13 degrees of freedom). CONCLUSIONS: Regression trees can be used to hypothesize about joint effects of exposure mixtures and may be particularly useful in the field of air pollution epidemiology for gaining a better understanding of complex multipollutant exposures.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: 8% of the US population has asthma. Air pollution is linked to exacerbation in susceptible individuals. The objective was to identify air pollutants that increased the risk of asthma emergency department visits during a time wherein a polluting factory was criminally convicted, changing local air pollutant levels. METHODS: An ecological time-series design used a daily count of asthma emergency visits from 2007 to 2012 as the dependent variable. Independent variables air pollutants (NO2, PM2.5 CO, and O3), controlling for meteorological conditions, were analyzed using time-series and Poisson GLM models. RESULTS: 76,651 emergency asthma visits were included with an average of 35 visits per day (SD = 9.2, range 11-80) in a stationary time series. Increased visit volume in fall and spring had no associations to the air pollutants. Associations between individual air pollutants occurred in otherwise low-volume months for asthma emergency visits. The strongest relationship was an 11.6% increase in the asthma emergency visit rate during the month of June. In monthly groupings that removed most of the autumn and spring months, O3, PM2.5, CO, and NO2 were associated with 5, 4, 2, and 2% increases in asthma emergency visits, respectively. CO was the only pollutant with a negative association with asthma emergency visits, occurring in the month of April. CONCLUSIONS: Pollutants NO2, PM2.5 CO, and O3 were associated with increased emergency asthma visits in some, but not all months of the year. Air pollution's impact on asthma emergencies may be masked by other, more influential seasonal triggers, such as infections or allergies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to air pollutants and low temperatures significantly impacts respiratory health. However, quantitative evidence on the economic burden attributable to these environmental exposures. This study aims to quantify the impact of air pollutants and temperature on hospitalization costs for influenza and pneumonia in Changchun, a representative cold industrial city in China. METHODS: We analyzed inpatient data (2017-2020) for influenza and pneumonia from major hospitals, alongside daily meteorological and air pollutant data. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM) were employed to assess the associations of pollutant concentrations and temperature with hospitalization costs, respectively, while controlling for confounding factors. RESULTS: Among 162,621 respiratory inpatients, influenza and pneumonia accounted for 75,113 cases (46.19%) and 990.21 million yuan in costs (41.29%). A 10 µg/m³ increase in PM₂.₅ and SO₂ was associated with immediate cost increases of 0.89% (95% CI: 0.66%, 1.11%) and 3.02% (95% CI: 2.03%, 4.02%), respectively. Extreme cold temperatures (below - 17.91 °C) led to a significant 6.01% (95% CI: 2.02%, 10.16%) increase in same-day costs, with a peak cumulative increase of 33.55% over lag 0-8 days. Children, the elderly, and males were identified as high-risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: This pioneering study provides the first economic burden assessment of environmental exposures on respiratory diseases in China's cold industrial regions, quantifying the substantial cost impacts of air pollutants and extreme cold. Our findings underscore the urgent need for targeted emission control policies, public health interventions during cold waves, and prioritized protection for vulnerable demographics to alleviate the economic burden of respiratory diseases.",

      "title": "Ambient air pollution is associated with pediatric pneumonia: a time-stratified case-crossover study in an urban area.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia, the leading reason underlying childhood deaths, may be triggered or exacerbated by air pollution. To date, only a few studies have examined the association of air pollution with emergency department (ED) visits for pediatric pneumonia, with inconsistent results. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the impact of short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and other air pollutants on the incidence of ED visits for pediatric pneumonia. METHODS: PM2.5, PM10, and other air pollutant levels were measured at 11 air quality-monitoring stations in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, between 2008 and 2014. Further, we extracted the medical records of non-trauma patients aged ≤17 years and who had visited an ED with the principal diagnosis of pneumonia. A time-stratified case-crossover study design was employed to determine the hazard effect of air pollution in a total of 4024 patients. RESULTS: The single-pollutant model suggested that per interquartile range increment in PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on 3 days before the event increased the odds of pediatric pneumonia by 14.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.1-23.8%], 10.9% (95% CI, 2.4-20.0%), 14.1% (95% CI, 5.0-24.1%), and 4.5% (95% CI, 0.8-8.4%), respectively. In two-pollutant models, PM2.5 and NO2 were significant after adjusting for PM10 and SO2. Subgroup analyses showed that older children (aged ≥4 years) were more susceptible to PM2.5 (interaction p = 0.024) and children were more susceptible to NO2 during warm days (≥26.5 °C, interaction p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 possibly plays an important role in pediatric pneumonia in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Older children are more susceptible to PM2.5, and all children are more susceptible to NO2 during warm days.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We examined the association of infant bronchiolitis with acute exposure to ambient air pollutants. DESIGN: We employed a time-stratified case-crossover method and based the exposure windows on a priori, biologically based hypotheses. PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated effects in 19,901 infants in the South Coast Air Basin of California in 1995-2000 with a hospital discharge record for bronchiolitis in the first year of life (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, CM466.1). EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: Study subjects' ZIP code was linked to ambient air pollution monitors to derive exposures. We estimated the risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization associated with increases in wintertime ambient air pollutants using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We observed no increased risk after acute exposure to particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, or nitrogen dioxide. PM2.5 exposure models suggested a 26-41% increased risk in the most premature infants born at gestational ages between 25 and 29 weeks; however, these findings were based on very small numbers. CONCLUSIONS: We found little support for a link between acute increases in ambient air pollution and infant bronchiolitis except modestly increased risk for PM2.5 exposure among infants born very prematurely. In these infants, the periods of viral acquisition and incubation concurred with the time of increased risk. RELEVANCE TO PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: We present novel data for the infant period and the key respiratory disease of infancy, bronchiolitis. Incompletely explained trends in rising bronchiolitis hospitalization rates and increasing number of infants born prematurely underscore the importance of evaluating the impact of ambient air pollution in this age group in other populations and studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and heat are strong predictors of morbidity, yet few studies have examined the effects of long-term exposures on non-fatal events, or assessed the short and long-term effect on health simultaneously. OBJECTIVE: We jointly investigated the association of short and long-term exposures to PM2.5 and temperature with hospital admissions, and explored the modification of the associations with the short-term exposures by one another and by temperature variability. METHODS: Daily ZIP code counts of respiratory, cardiac and stroke admissions of adults ≥65 (N = 2,015,660) were constructed across New-England (2001-2011). Daily PM2.5 and temperature exposure estimates were obtained from satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved models. For each admission cause, a Poisson regression was fit on short and long-term exposures, with a random intercept for ZIP code. Modifications of the short-term effects were tested by adding interaction terms with temperature, PM2.5 and temperature variability. RESULTS: Associations between short and long-term exposures were observed for all of the outcomes, with stronger effects of long-term exposures to PM2.5. For respiratory admissions, the short-term PM2.5 effect (percent increase per IQR) was larger on warmer days (1.12% versus -0.53%) and in months of higher temperature variability (1.63% versus -0.45%). The short-term temperature effect was higher in months of higher temperature variability as well. For cardiac admissions, the PM2.5 effect was larger on colder days (0.56% versus -0.30%) and in months of higher temperature variability (0.99% versus -0.56%). CONCLUSIONS: We observed synergistic effects of short-term exposures to PM2.5, temperature and temperature variability. Long-term exposures to PM2.5 were associated with larger effects compared to short-term exposures.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) pollution during the warm season has become a growing public health concern. The interaction between PM2.5 and O3 and its contribution to disease burden associated with co-pollution has not been thoroughly examined. We collected data on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases from a city-wide hospital discharge database in Beijing between 2013 and 2019. City-wide 24-h mean PM2.5 and daily maximum 8-h mean O3 were averaged from 35 monitoring stations across Beijing. Conditional Poisson regression was employed to estimate the interaction between warm-season PM2.5 and O3 on respiratory admissions. A model incorporating a tensor product term was used to fit the non-linear interaction and estimate the number of respiratory admissions attributable to PM2.5 and O3 pollution. From January 18, 2013 to December 31, 2019, 1,191,308 respiratory admissions were recorded. We observed multiplicative interactions between warm-season PM2.5 and O3 on upper respiratory infections (P = 0.004), pneumonia (P = 0.002), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.041), and total respiratory disease (P < 0.001). PM2.5-O3 co-pollution during warm season exhibited a super-additive effect on respiratory admissions, with a relative excess risk due to interaction of 1.65% (95%CI: 0.46%-2.84%). There was a non-linear pattern of the synergistic effect between PM2.5 and O3 on respiratory admissions. Based on the World Health Organization global air quality guidelines, 12,421 respiratory admissions would be reduced if both daily PM2.5 and O3 concentrations had not exceeded the target (PM2.5 15 μg/m3, O3 100 μg/m3). The number of respiratory admissions attributable to either PM2.5 or O3 pollution decreased by 48.7% from 2013 to 2019. Prioritizing O3 control during the warm season is a cost-effective strategy for Beijing. These findings underscore the significance of concurrently addressing both PM2.5 pollution and O3 pollution during the warm season to alleviate the burden of respiratory diseases.",

In Cook and Maricopa counties I had admissions information only for the elderly (ages 65 yr and over). In Los Angeles County I had admissions information for all ages. In all three counties I had monitoring information on PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3. In Los Angeles County, I had information on PM2.5 in addition. In Cook and Maricopa counties there was weak evidence of an association between the gaseous pollutants other than ozone and admissions. There was no evidence of an association with PM. In Cook and Los Angeles counties, in single-pollutant models, ozone was associated with admissions during the period April-September but not in full-year analyses. In Los Angeles, the other gases were strongly associated with COPD admissions. PM was also associated with admissions in single-pollutant models. The coefficients for PM were greatly attenuated and became insignificant in joint analyses with any one of the gases (with the exception of ozone). Analyses in three broad age ranges (0-19, 20-64, and 65 yr and over) yielded similar results. The results indicate that the gases, other than ozone, were more strongly associated with COPD admissions than PM and that there was considerable heterogeneity in the effects of individual pollutants in different geographic areas of the country.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: To date, there is no published local epidemiological evidence documenting the respiratory health effects of source-specific air pollution in South Asia, where particulate matter ⩽2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) composition is different from past studies. Differences include more biomass and residue crop-burning emissions, which may have differing health implications. Objectives: We assessed PM2.5 associations with respiratory emergency department (ED) visits in a biomass-burning-dominated high-pollution region and evaluated their variability by pollution source and composition. Methods: Time-series regression modeling was applied to daily ED visits from January 2014 through December 2017. Air pollutant effect sizes were estimated after addressing long-term trends and seasonality, day of week, holidays, relative humidity, ambient temperature, and the effect modification by season, age, and sex. Results: PM2.5 yielded a significant association with increased respiratory ED visits (0.84%; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-1.35%) per 10-μg/m3 increase. The PM2.5 health effect size varied with season, the highest being during monsoon season, when fossil-fuel combustion sources dominated exposures. Results from a source-specific health effect analysis were also consistent with fossil-fuel PM2.5 having a larger effect size per 10 μg/m3 than PM2.5 from other sources (fossil-fuel PM2.5: 2.79% [0.33-5.31%], biomass-burning PM2.5: 1.27% [0-2.54%], and other PM2.5: 0.95% [0.06-1.85%]). Age-specific associations varied, with children and older adults being disproportionately affected by the air pollution, especially by the combustion-related particles. Conclusions: This study provided novel and important evidence that respiratory health in Dhaka is significantly affected by particle air pollution, with a greater health impact by fossil-fuel combustion-derived PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between ambient air pollution and hospitalization for respiratory infections among children who were younger than 15 years in Toronto during a 4-year period (1998-2001). METHODS: Exposures averaged during periods that varied from 1 to 7 days were used to assess the effects of air pollutants, including thoracic particulate matter (PM10), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10-2.5) particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on hospitalization for respiratory infections. A case-crossover design was used to calculate odds ratios for the hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions with an incremented exposure corresponding to the interquartile range in air pollution exposures. RESULTS: When particulate matter and gaseous pollutants were mutually taken into account, the effect remained pronounced for PM10-2.5 in both boys and girls. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-day average exposure to PM10-2.5 with an increment of 6.5 microg/m3 was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.30) for boys and 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.36) for girls. The effect also remained for PM10 in boys and for NO2 in girls. PM2.5, CO, SO2, and O3 showed no significant effects on hospitalization for respiratory infection in both genders when other pollutants were taken into consideration. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested a detrimental effect of relatively low levels of ambient particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, especially coarse particulate matter and NO2, on hospitalization for respiratory infections in children.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have been conducted on the effect of air pollution on morbidity in Latin America. This study analyzed the effects of air pollution on respiratory and circulatory morbidity in four major cities in Colombia. An ecological time-series analysis was conducted with pollution data from air quality monitoring networks and information on emergency department visits between 2011 and 2014. Daily 24-h averages were calculated for NO₂, PM10, PM2.5, and SO₂ as well as 8-h averages for CO and O₃. Separate time-series were constructed by disease group and pollutant. Conditional negative binomial regression models were used with average population effects. Effects were calculated for the same day and were adjusted for weather conditions, age groups, and their interactions. The results showed that effects of some of the pollutants differed among the cities. For NO₂, PM10, and PM2.5, the multi-city models showed greater and statistically significant percentage increases in emergency department visits for respiratory diseases, particularly for the 5 to 9-year-old age group. These same pollutants also significantly affected the rate of emergency department visits for circulatory diseases, especially for the group of persons over 60 years of age.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the specific PM2.5-bound metallic elements that contribute to asthma emergency department visits by using a case-crossover study design. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 11,410 asthma emergency department visits as case group and 22,820 non-asthma onset dates occurring one week and two weeks preceding the case day as controls from 2017 to 2020. PM2.5 monitoring data and 35 PM.2.5-bound metallic elements from six different regions in Taiwan were collected. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between asthma and PM2.5-bound metallic elements. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed a statistically significant risk of asthma emergency department visits associated with PM2.5 exposure at lag 0, 1, 2, and 3 during autumn. Additionally, PM2.5-bound hafnium (Hf), thallium (Tl), rubidium (Rb), and aluminum (Al) exhibited a consistently significant positive correlation with asthma emergency department visits at lags 1, 2, and 3. In stratified analyses by area, age, and sex, PM2.5-bound Hf showed a significant and consistent correlation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of PM2.5-bound metallic elements effects in asthma exacerbations, particularly for Hf. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the origins of these metallic elements and pursuing emission reductions to mitigate regional health risks.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to particulate matter (PM) pollution is a significant health risk, driving the search for innovative metrics that more accurately reflect the potential harm to human health. Among these, oxidative potential (OP) has emerged as a promising health-based metric, yet its application and relevance across different environments remain to be further explored. This study, set in two high-altitude Bolivian cities, aims to identify the most significant sources of PM-induced oxidation in the lungs and assess the utility of OP in assessing PM health impacts. Utilizing two distinct assays, OPDTT and OPDCFH, we measured the OP of PM samples, while also examining the associations between PM mass, OP, and black carbon (BC) concentrations with hospital visits for acute respiratory infections (ARI) and pneumonia over a range of exposure lags (0-2 weeks) using a Poisson regression model adjusted for meteorological conditions. The analysis also leveraged Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to link these health outcomes to specific PM sources, building on a prior source apportionment study utilizing the same dataset. Our findings highlight anthropogenic combustion, particularly from traffic and biomass burning, as the primary contributors to OP in these urban sites. Significant correlations were observed between both OPDTT and PM2.5 concentration exposure and ARI hospital visits, alongside a notable association with pneumonia cases and OPDTT levels. Furthermore, PMF analysis demonstrated a clear link between traffic-related pollution and increased hospital admissions for respiratory issues, affirming the health impact of these sources. These results underscore the potential of OPDTT as a valuable metric for assessing the health risks associated with acute PM exposure, showcasing its broader application in environmental health studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The high risks for childhood respiratory diseases are associated with exposure to ambient air pollution. However, there are few studies that have explored the association between air pollution exposure and respiratory diseases among young children (particularly aged 0-2 years) based on the entire population in a megalopolis. METHODS: Daily hospital admission records were obtained from 54 municipal hospitals in Wuhan city, China. We included all children (aged 0-2 years) hospitalized with respiratory diseases between January 2017 and December 2018. Individual air pollution exposure assessment was used in Land Use Regression model and inverse distance weighted. Case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate the hospitalization risk associated with air pollutants. RESULTS: We identified 62,425 hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, of which 36,295 were pneumonia. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were significantly associated with respiratory diseases and pneumonia. ORs of pneumonia were 1.0179 (95% CI 1.0097-1.0260) for PM2.5 and 1.0131 (95% CI 1.0042-1.0220) for NO2 at lag 0-7 days. Subgroup analysis suggested that NO2, Ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) only showed effects on pneumonia hospitalizations on male patients, but PM2.5 had effects on patients of both genders. Except O3, all pollutants were strongly associated with pneumonia in cold season. In addition, children who aged elder months and who were in central urban areas had a higher hospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution is associated with higher hospitalization risk for respiratory diseases, especially pneumonia, among young children, and the risk is related to gender, month age, season and residential location.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies found exposure to air pollution leads to exacerbations of asthma in paediatric and adult patients and increases asthma-related emergency hospital admissions (AREHA). METHODS: AREHAs and levels of air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) were obtained from Mexico City for the period 2017-2019. A time-series approach was used to explore the relationship between air pollutants and AREHA. Relative risks of AREHA were estimated using a negative binomial regression in young children (less than 5 years) and adults (greater than 18 years). RESULTS: There was a positive association between AREHA and PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 in adults, which remained after mutual adjustment for these pollutants. The relative risk (RR) of admission in adults increased by 3% (95% CI 1% to 4%) for a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10, 1% (0.03% to 3%) for a 5 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and by 1% (0.06% to 2%) for a 5 µg/m3 increase in NO2. In contrast, in young children, AREHAs were negatively associated with PM10 after adjustment for NO2 (RR 0.97 (0.95 to 0.99) for a 10 µg/m3 and with NO2 after adjustment for PM10 and PM2.5 (RR 0.98 (0.96 to 0.99) and 0.97 (0.96 to 0.99), respectively, for a 5 µg/m3 increase in NO2). AREHAs in children were not associated with PM2.5 after adjustment for NO2. CONCLUSIONS: Ambient air pollution, within the previous week, was associated with emergency hospital admissions for asthma to public hospitals in adults in Mexico City. The relationship in children was less consistent. Further work is needed to explore why differences between adults and children exist to inform appropriate interventions to benefit public health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure measurement error in copollutant epidemiologic models has the potential to introduce bias in relative risk (RR) estimates. A simulation study was conducted using empirical data to quantify the impact of correlated measurement errors in time-series analyses of air pollution and health. METHODS: ZIP-code level estimates of exposure for six pollutants (CO, NOx, EC, PM2.5, SO4, O3) from 1999 to 2002 in the Atlanta metropolitan area were used to calculate spatial, population (i.e. ambient versus personal), and total exposure measurement error. Empirically determined covariance of pollutant concentration pairs and the associated measurement errors were used to simulate true exposure (exposure without error) from observed exposure. Daily emergency department visits for respiratory diseases were simulated using a Poisson time-series model with a main pollutant RR = 1.05 per interquartile range, and a null association for the copollutant (RR = 1). Monte Carlo experiments were used to evaluate the impacts of correlated exposure errors of different copollutant pairs. RESULTS: Substantial attenuation of RRs due to exposure error was evident in nearly all copollutant pairs studied, ranging from 10 to 40% attenuation for spatial error, 3-85% for population error, and 31-85% for total error. When CO, NOx or EC is the main pollutant, we demonstrated the possibility of false positives, specifically identifying significant, positive associations for copollutants based on the estimated type I error rate. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of exposure error must be considered when interpreting results of copollutant epidemiologic models, due to the possibility of attenuation of main pollutant RRs and the increased probability of false positives when measurement error is present.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The adverse health effects of exposure to air pollution have been well-established and include mortality, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, etc, but also less severe outcomes such as medication use and purchase. The economic impact, an additional motivator for policy, has been studied primarily for the more severe outcomes. METHODS: Purchase data of reimbursed medications typically prescribed for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were obtained through the mandatory Belgian health insurance system. A time series analyses approach was used to model daily sales on daily air pollution concentrations (NO2, PM10 and PM2.5) for residents of the Brussels Capital Region as a whole. In addition, a higher geographical resolution of both sales and pollutant concentrations allowed for a multi-sector approach. Annual savings were estimated for the scenario of a 10% reduction in each of the pollutants. RESULTS: Medication purchase was significantly associated with NO2 concentrations, leading to an annual cost saving potential of € 107,845 [95%CI: € 71,483-€ 143,823] in R03 sales (WHO classification for drugs of obstructive airway diseases). Saving potentials of PM10 and PM2.5 were not significant. Estimates were not sensitive to the geographical resolution, however, higher precision can be obtained with higher resolution data, subject to the condition that the number of sales is sufficiently large.",

      "title": "Ambient air pollution and daily pediatric hospitalizations for asthma.",
      "abstract": "GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: A series of severe air pollution episodes in Europe and North America prior to 1960 have focused scientific and regulatory attention on the adverse effects of air pollution on human health. As a consequence of significant reductions in ambient air pollution levels in the intervening years, scientists and public health officials have become more concerned with the potential health effects of exposure to routine concentrations of air pollution. Several recent time series studies conducted worldwide have found relatively low levels of air pollutants that are below national standards were associated with adverse effects on mortality and morbidity. This study examined the effects of ambient air pollution indicators on the daily rate of pediatric hospital admissions for asthma in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area from 2001-2003. METHODS: Data were collected for the number of children < or = 14 years old hospitalized for asthma on a daily basis (N = 1270) and ambient concentrations of NO2, O3, PM2.5, mold and pollen concentrations, and meso-scale meteorological conditions. Results. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed significant relationships between the total number of hospitalizations per day and the one-hour maximum NO2 level, the proportion of susceptible children < 5 years old, and the ratio of temperature to humidity. DISCUSSION: This study of the total number of children aged < or = 14 years old experiencing hospitalizations on a daily basis in the Oklahoma City area from 2001-2003 underscores factors other than ambient air pollution, especially when concentrations are low, affect hospitalizations for pediatric asthma. For example, information related to indoor air quality, health care, family history, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and other irritants are not obtainable. Yet, those factors are risk drivers for asthma. Similarly, health privacy requirements prevented obtaining data on physiological factors specific to each child such as differentials in airways functional capacity or other impairments influenced asthma exacerbation. This makes calculating relative risk inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Although ambient air pollution concentrations and meteorological conditions influence pediatric asthma hospitalizations, they are not the major predictors in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This is consistent with other research that finds limited effects associated with low levels for concentrations of the criteria pollutants. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Although limiting concentrations for criteria air pollutants to levels below human health-based standards exhibited beneficial effects, other factors also need to be identified and addressed in order to reduce pediatric hospitalizations for asthma.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution effects on cardiovascular hospitalizations in small urban/suburban areas have been scantly investigated. Such effects were assessed among the participants in the analytical epidemiological survey carried out in Pisa and Cascina, Tuscany, Italy (2009-2011). Cardiovascular hospitalizations from 1585 subjects were followed up (2011-2015). Daily mean pollutant concentrations were estimated through random forests at 1 km (particulate matter: PM10, 2011-2015; PM2.5, 2013-2015) and 200 m (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3, 2013-2015) resolutions. Exposure effects were estimated using the case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression (odds ratio-OR-and 95% confidence interval-CI-for 10 μg/m3 increase; lag 0-6). During the period 2011-2015 (137 hospitalizations), a significant effect at lag 0 was observed for PM10 (OR = 1.137, CI: 1.023-1.264) at 1 km resolution. During the period 2013-2015 (69 hospitalizations), significant effects at lag 0 were observed for PM10 (OR = 1.268, CI: 1.085-1.483) and PM2.5 (OR = 1.273, CI: 1.053-1.540) at 1 km resolution, as well as for PM10 (OR = 1.365, CI: 1.103-1.690), PM2.5 (OR = 1.264, CI: 1.006-1.589) and NO2 (OR = 1.477, CI: 1.058-2.061) at 200 m resolution; significant effects were observed up to lag 2. Larger ORs were observed in males and in subjects reporting pre-existent cardiovascular/respiratory diseases. Combining analytical and routine epidemiological data with high-resolution pollutant estimates provides new insights on acute cardiovascular effects in the general population and in potentially susceptible subgroups living in small urban/suburban areas.",

      "abstract": "Air pollutants have significant direct and indirect adverse effects on public health. To explore the relationship between air pollutants and meteorological conditions on the hospitalization for respiratory diseases, we collected a whole year of daily major air pollutants' concentrations from Shenzhen city in 2013, including Particulate Matter (PM10, PM2.5), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), and Carbon monoxide (CO). Meanwhile, we also gained meteorological data. This study collected 109,927 patients cases with diseases of the respiratory system from 98 hospitals. We investigated the influence of meteorological factors on air pollution by Spearman correlation analysis. Then, we tested the short-term correlation between significant air pollutants and respiratory diseases' hospitalization by Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM). There was a significant negative correlation between the north wind and NO2 and a significant negative correlation between the south wind and six pollutants. Except for CO, other air pollutants were significantly correlated with the number of hospitalized patients during the lag period. Most of the pollutants reached maximum Relative Risk (RR) with a lag of five days. When the time lag was five days, the annual average of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and O3 increased by 10%, and the risk of hospitalization for the respiratory system increased by 0.29%, 0.23%, 0.22%, 0.25%, and 0.22%, respectively. All the pollutants except CO impact the respiratory system's hospitalization in a short period, and PM10 has the most significant impact. The results are helpful for pollution control from a public health perspective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Population-based short-term air pollution health studies often have limited spatiotemporally representative exposure data, leading to concerns of exposure measurement error. OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of monitoring and modeled exposure metrics in time-series analyses of air pollution and cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: We obtained daily counts of ED visits for Atlanta, GA during 2009-2013. We leveraged daily ZIP code level concentration estimates for eight pollutants from nine exposure metrics. Metrics included central monitor (CM), monitor-based (inverse distance weighting, kriging), model-based [community multiscale air quality (CMAQ), land use regression (LUR)], and satellite-based measures. We used Poisson models to estimate air pollution health associations using the different exposure metrics. The approach involved: (1) assessing CM-based associations, (2) determining if non-CM metrics can reproduce CM-based associations, and (3) identifying potential value added of incorporating full spatiotemporal information provided by non-CM metrics. RESULTS: Using CM exposures, we observed associations between cardiovascular ED visits and carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter, elemental and organic carbon, and between respiratory ED visits and ozone. Non-CM metrics were largely able to reproduce CM-based associations, although some unexpected results using CMAQ- and LUR-based metrics reduced confidence in these data for some spatiotemporally-variable pollutants. Associations with nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide were only detected, or were stronger, when using metrics that incorporate all available monitoring data (i.e., inverse distance weighting and kriging). SIGNIFICANCE: The use of routinely-collected ambient monitoring data for exposure assignment in time-series studies of large metropolitan areas is a sound approach, particularly when data from multiple monitors are available. More sophisticated approaches derived from CMAQ, LUR, or satellites may add value when monitoring data are inadequate and if paired with thorough data characterization. These results are useful for interpretation of existing literature and for improving exposure assessment in future studies. IMPACT STATEMENT: This study compared and interpreted the use of monitoring and modeled exposure metrics in a daily time-series analysis of air pollution and cardiorespiratory emergency department visits. The results suggest that the use of routinely-collected ambient monitoring data in population-based short-term air pollution and health studies is a sound approach for exposure assignment in large metropolitan regions. CMAQ-, LUR-, and satellite-based metrics may allow for health effects estimation when monitoring data are sparse, if paired with thorough data characterization. These results are useful for interpretation of existing health effects literature and for improving exposure assessment in future air pollution epidemiology studies.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed, at a postcode detailed level, the relation-ship between short-term exposure to environmental factors and hospital ad-missions, in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and ICU mortality due to COVID-19 during the lockdown and post-lockdown 2020 period in Spain. METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based retrospective study on 208,744 patients admitted to Spanish hospitals due to COVID-19 based on the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) during the first two waves of the pandemic in 2020. Environmental data were obtained from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. The association was assessed by a generalized additive model. RESULTS: PM2.5 was the most critical environmental factor related to hospital admissions and hospital mortality due to COVID-19 during the lockdown in Spain, PM10, NO2, and SO2and also showed associations. The effect was considerably reduced during the post-lockdown period. ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients were mainly associated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 during the lockdown as well. During the lockdown, exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 were the most critical environmental factors related to ICU mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to air pollutants impacts COVID-19 out-comes during the lockdown, especially PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2. These pollutants are associated with hospital admission, hospital mortality and ICU admission, while ICU mortality is mainly associated with PM2.5 and PM10. Our findings reveal the importance of monitoring air pollutants in respiratory infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution is a significant contributor to the global burden of kidney disease. Although acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common secondary event in ill patients, evidence regarding the association between air pollution and AKI accompanied by specific comorbidities is limited. This study aimed to estimate the association between short-term exposure to air pollution (fine particulate matter ≤2.5 μm [PM2.5] and ozone [O3]) and incident AKI by comorbid diseases using the Korea National Health Information Database (NHID). Total of 160,390 incident AKI cases, defined as an emergency department (ED) visit due to AKI, were observed within the period 2015-2021 in inland South Korea. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied for PM2.5 and O3 individually, using a conditional logistic regression model within each case and its own control (three or four days of the same day of the week in the same month) to estimate the association between short-term air pollution exposure and ED visits due to AKI. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 was associated with ED visits due to AKI with ORs of 1.008 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999, 1.017) and 1.019 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.033) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in lag 0-1 day PM2.5 and O3 respectively, although OR for PM2.5 was marginally significant. The odds of incident AKI associated with PM2.5 was evident in conjunction with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. For O3, the estimated odds was prominent for AKI with ischemic heart disease. In addition, the comorbid disease-specific odds of AKI attributed to air pollution varied by sex and age. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence of a plausible mechanism between air pollution and incident AKI and suggest the need for personalized AKI prevention strategies attributed to air pollution.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution exposure may increase the demand for emergency healthcare services, particularly in South-East Asia, where the burden of air-pollution-related health impacts is high. This article aims to investigate the association between air quality and emergency hospital admissions in Singapore. Quasi-Poisson regression was applied with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to assess the short-term associations between air quality variations and all-cause, emergency admissions from a major hospital in Singapore, between 2009 and 2017. Higher concentrations of SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO were positively associated with an increased risk of (i) all-cause, (ii) cardiovascular-related, and (iii) respiratory-related emergency admissions over 7 days. O3 concentration increases were associated with a non-linear decrease in emergency admissions. Females experienced a higher risk of emergency admissions associated with PM2.5, PM10, and CO exposure, and a lower risk of admissions with NO2 exposure, compared to males. The older adults (≥65 years) experienced a higher risk of emergency admissions associated with SO2 and O3 exposure compared to the non-elderly group. We found significant positive associations between respiratory disease- and cardiovascular disease-related emergency hospital admissions and ambient SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO concentrations. Age and gender were identified as effect modifiers of all-cause admissions.",

      "abstract": "A study on the relationships between ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, SO₂ and NO₂) and hospital emergency room visits (ERVs) for respiratory diseases from 2013 to 2014 was performed in both urban and suburban areas of Jinan, a heavily air-polluted city in Eastern China. This research was analyzed using generalized additive models (GAM) with Poisson regression, which controls for long-time trends, the \"day of the week\" effect and meteorological parameters. An increase of 10 μg/m³ in PM2.5, SO₂ and NO₂ corresponded to a 1.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7%, 2.1%), 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5%, 1.9%), and 2.5% (95%: 0.8%, 4.2%) growth in ERVs for the urban population, respectively, and a 1.5% (95%: 0.4%, 2.6%), 0.8% (95%: -0.7%, 2.3%), and 3.1% (95%: 0.5%, 5.7%) rise in ERVs for the suburban population, respectively. It was found that females were more susceptible than males to air pollution in the urban area when the analysis was stratified by gender, and the reverse result was seen in the suburban area. Our results suggest that the increase in ERVs for respiratory illnesses is linked to the levels of air pollutants in Jinan, and there may be some urban-suburban discrepancies in health outcomes from air pollutant exposure.",

We investigated the association between ultra-short-term exposure to air pollution and risk of childhood asthma exacerbations. Hourly data on emergency department visits (EDVs) for asthma in children during 2013-2015 in Brisbane, Australia, were obtained. We undertook time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the hourly association between exposure to air pollutants (particles with diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), particles with diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) and risk of EDVs for asthma after controlling for temperature, relative humidity, public holidays and circulating levels of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Risk of EDVs for asthma increased within a few hours after exposure to O3 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.170, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003-1.365) or NO2 (OR: 1.359, 95%CI: 1.049-1.760). The association between O3 exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was stronger in boys (OR: 1.244, 95%CI: 1.025-1.511) than that in girls (OR: 1.055, 95%CI: 0.818-1.361).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease, eventually leading to respiratory failure. Although the only currently available therapeutic interventions merely slow the disease progression, few studies have examined risk factors associated with ALS exacerbation and progression. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between exposure to short-term air pollution and acute exacerbation of ALS requiring emergency department (ED) visit. METHODS: We identified from the national emergency database of Korea 617 patients who visited EDs in Seoul with ALS as a primary cause during the period 2008-2014. We estimated short-term exposure to particles <2.5 μm (PM2.5), particles <10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). We conducted a conditional logistic regression with a time-stratified case-crossover design to examine the association between ED visits for ALS and short-term exposure to interquartile range (IQR) increase and upper quartile levels of air pollutants on the day of the ED visit, compared to the control days matched to day of the week, month, and year. RESULTS: The risk of ED visits for ALS was significantly associated with an IQR increase of PM2.5 [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.35], PM10 [OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.25], SO2 [OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.41], and CO [OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.36]. Exposure to the highest quartiles of PM2.5 and PM10 showed higher associations with ED visits for ALS [OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.85 and OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.77]. DISCUSSION: We provide new evidence that exposure to short-term air pollution may increase the risk of acute exacerbation of ALS. Further studies are warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: There is significant evidence of increased healthcare utilization from cardiopulmonary causes in adults from exposure to wildfire smoke, but evidence in pediatric age groups is limited.Objectives: To quantify and examine the healthcare utilization effects of the December 2017 Lilac Fire in San Diego County among pediatric patients at the Rady Children's Hospital (RCH) emergency department and urgent care (UC) clinics.Methods: Using data from 2011 to 2017, including data on daily particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) in an inverse-distance interpolation model and RCH electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed pediatric respiratory visits at the RCH emergency department and UC clinics during the Santa Ana wind (SAW)-driven Lilac Fire from December 7 to 16, 2017. An interrupted time series study design was applied as our primary analysis to compare the observed pediatric respiratory visits from December 7 to 16, 2017 to what would have occurred in a counterfactual situation, namely, if the Lilac Fire had not occurred. A complementary descriptive spatial analysis was also used to evaluate the geographic distribution of respiratory visits in relationship to satellite imaging of the Lilac Fire and the associated wind pattern.Results: The Lilac Fire was associated with 16.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.2-20.9) excess respiratory visits per day at the RCH emergency department across all pediatric age groups. Children aged 0 to 5 years had the highest absolute excess respiratory visits per day with 7.3 (95% CI, 3.0-11.7), whereas those aged 6 to 12 years had the highest relative increase in visits, with 3.4 (95% CI, 2.3-4.6). RCH UC clinics had similar results. The top five ZIP codes in San Diego County with the highest standard deviations of age-adjusted respiratory visits were all located generally downwind of the fire perimeter, as expected for the SAW pattern.Conclusions: We have demonstrated an increase in pediatric respiratory visits during the SAW-driven Lilac Fire in San Diego County in a patterned geographic distribution that is attributable to an increase in PM2.5 exposure. Younger children were particularly affected. Climate change is expected to result in more frequent and extensive wildfires in the region and will require greater preparedness and adaptation efforts to protect vulnerable populations, such as young children.",

Simultaneously, morbidity (hospitalizations) and mortality data were collected in 2012 using the ESPS (Enquête Santé et Protection Sociale/Health, Health Care and Insurance Survey) survey data and the CepiDc (Centre d'Épidémiologie sur les Causes Médicales de Décès/French Epidemiology Centre on Medical Causes of Death) database. Based on Poisson regression analyses, the long-term effect was estimated. A higher risk of all-cause mortality was observed using CépiDc database, with a relative risk of 1.024 (95% CI: 1.022, 1.026) and 1.029 (95% CI: 1.027, 1.031) for a 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases likewise exhibited long-term associations with both PM2.5 and PM10. Using ESPS survey data, a significant risk was observed for both PM2.5 and PM10 in all-cause mortality and all-cause morbidity. Although a risk for higher all-cause mortality and morbidity was also present for NO₂, the cause-specific relative risk due to NO₂ was found to be lesser, as compared to PM. Nevertheless, cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity were related to NO₂, along with PM2.5 and PM10. However, the health effect of O₃ was seen to be substantially lower in comparison to the other pollutants. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that PM has a long-term impact on mortality and morbidity. Exposure to NO₂ and O₃ could also lead to increased health risks.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical experiments demonstrate that the asthmatic response to an aeroallergen can be enhanced by prior exposure to an air pollutant. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effects of ambient aeroallergens on hospitalization for asthma between high and low air pollution days in 11 large Canadian cities. METHODS: Daily time-series analysis was used, and results were adjusted for day of the week, temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. RESULTS: The relative risk of admission for an interquartile increase in tree pollen levels was 1.124 (95% CI, 1.101-1.147) on days of lower values of fine particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)) compared with 1.179 (95% CI, 1.149-1.21) on days of higher PM(2.5) values. Significant (P ≤ .05) differences in the relative risks of admission between lower versus higher values of particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 μm in diameter were 1.149 (95% CI, 1.118-1.181) versus 1.210 (95% CI, 1.161-1.261) for ascomycetes, 1.112 (95% CI, 1.085-1.14) versus 1.302 (95% CI, 1.242-1.364) for basidiomycetes, 1.159 (95% CI, 1.125-1.195) versus 1.149 (95% CI, 1.129-1.169) for deuteromycetes, and 1.061 (95% CI, 1.016-1.107) versus 1.117 (95% CI, 1.092-1.143) for weeds. CONCLUSION: We identified an association between aeroallergens and hospitalizations for asthma, which was enhanced on days of higher air pollution. Minimizing exposure to air pollution might reduce allergic exacerbations of asthma.",

We evaluated the impact of PM2.5 alerts on mental disorder-related emergency visit and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover analysis comparing PM2.5 alert versus non-alert days between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2021 using multiple South Korean databases. Alert days were 1:1 matched to non-alert days on the basis of daily mean municipal-level of PM2.5. We applied conditional Poisson regression models, stratified by region, to estimate relative risks of mental disorder, related emergency department visits and mortality for PM2.5 alert. RESULTS: A 20 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with elevated risks of mental disorder-related emergency department visits and mortality. On PM2.5 alert days, the risk of mental disorder-related emergency visits was lower compared with matched non-alert days (RR = 0.94, 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 0.92, 0.97). This association was observed for both organic and non-organic mental disorders. All-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality showed small, non-significant increases on alert days. CONCLUSIONS: Issuance of PM2.5 alerts in South Korea was associated with a modest reduction in emergency visits for mental disorders but did not correspond with lower mortality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The burden of seasonal influenza on emergency department (ED) visits is poorly quantified due to case ascertainment and data availability challenges. This study estimates county-level respiratory ED visits attributable to influenza using time-series models and examines spatial heterogeneity in county-level burden in 3 states. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the county-level respiratory ED visits attributable to influenza using time-series models and examine spatial heterogeneity in county-level burden in 3 states. METHODS: We used daily hospital discharge records to measure community-level influenza activity in California (2005-2018), Georgia (2010-2018), and New York (2005-2018). County-level respiratory ED visit rates attributable to influenza were estimated by quasi-Poisson time-series models, adjusting for temporal trends and environmental factors. Bayesian spatial models were used to assess associations with county-level socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and chronic health condition prevalence. RESULTS: Influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates per 100,000 population were 226 (95% CI 206-246) in New York, 232 (95% CI 206-259) in California, and 547 (95% CI 506-589) in Georgia. A 10% increase in county-level poverty and uninsured rates was associated with higher influenza burden, increasing influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates by 160 (95% credible interval [CrI] 127-196) and 217 (95% CrI 168-265), respectively. Long-term PM2.5 (fine particulate matter ≤2.5 µm), humidity, and temperature also exhibited positive associations. Chronic conditions also increased ED visit rates by 1476/100,000 (95% CrI 1167-1778), 588/100,000 (95% CrI 400-747), and 488/100,000 (95% CrI 402-574) per 10% increase in stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes prevalence, respectively. These associations weakened after adjusting for socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity that is associated with county-level socioeconomic factors, environmental exposures, and chronic disease prevalence.",

      "title": "Impact of ultrafine particles and total particle number concentration on five cause-specific hospital admission endpoints in three German cities.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have shown associations between daily concentrations of fine particles (e.g., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm; PM2.5) and morbidity. However, evidence for ultrafine particles (UFP; particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10-100 nm) remains conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to examine the short-term associations of UFP with five cause-specific hospital admission endpoints for Leipzig, Dresden, and Augsburg, Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained daily counts of (cause-specific) cardiorespiratory hospital admissions between 2010 and 2017. Daily average concentrations of UFP, total particle number (PNC; 10-800 nm), and black carbon (BC) were measured at six sites; PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from monitoring networks. We assessed immediate (lag 0-1), delayed (lag 2-4, lag 5-7), and cumulative (lag 0-7) effects by applying station-specific confounder-adjusted Poisson regression models. We then used a novel multi-level meta-analytical method to obtain pooled risk estimates. Finally, we performed two-pollutant models to investigate interdependencies between pollutants and examined possible effect modification by age, sex, and season. RESULTS: UFP showed a delayed (lag 2-4) increase in respiratory hospital admissions of 0.69% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.28%; 1.67%]. For other hospital admission endpoints, we found only suggestive results. Larger particle size fractions, such as accumulation mode particles (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 100-800 nm), generally showed stronger effects (respiratory hospital admissions & lag 2-4: 1.55% [95% CI: 0.86%; 2.25%]). PM2.5 showed the most consistent associations for (cardio-)respiratory hospital admissions, whereas NO2 did not show any associations. Two-pollutant models showed independent effects of PM2.5 and BC. Moreover, higher risks have been observed for children. CONCLUSIONS: We observed clear associations with PM2.5 but UFP or PNC did not show a clear association across different exposure windows and cause-specific hospital admissions. Further multi-center studies are needed using harmonized UFP measurements to draw definite conclusions on the health effects of UFP.",

      "title": "Interim results of the study of particulates and health in Atlanta (SOPHIA).",
      "abstract": "Substantial evidence supports an association of particulate matter (PM) with cardiorespiratory illnesses, but little is known regarding characteristics of PM that might contribute to this association and the mechanisms of action. The Atlanta superstation sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute as part of the Aerosol Research and Inhalation Epidemiology Study (ARIES) study is monitoring chemical composition of ambient particles by size fraction, as well as a comprehensive suite of other pollutants, at a site in downtown Atlanta during the 25-month period, August 1, 1998-August 31, 2000. Our investigative team is making use of this unique resource in several morbidity studies, called the \"Study of Particulates and Health in Atlanta (SOPHIA)\". The study includes the following components: (1) a time series investigation of emergency department (ED) visits for the period during which the superstation is operating; (2) a time series investigation of ED visits during the 5 years prior to implementation of the superstation; and (3) a study of arrhythmic events in patients equipped with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICDs) for the period January 1, 1993-August 31, 2000. Thirty-three of 39 Atlanta area EDs are participating in the ED studies, comprising over a million annual ED visits. In this paper, we present initial analyses of data from 18 of the 33 participating EDs. The preliminary data set includes 1,662,713 ED visits during the pre-superstation time period and 559,480 visits during the superstation time period. Visits for four case groupings--asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysrhythmia, and all cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) combined--have been assessed relative to daily air quality indices, controlling for long-term temporal trends and meteorologic variables, using general linear models, generalized estimating equations and generalized additive models. Single-pollutant models predicting case visitation rates using moving averages of 0-, 1-, and 2-day lagged air quality variables were run. For the pre-superstation period, PM10 (24-h), ozone (8-h), SO2 (1-h), NO2 (1-h) and CO (1-h) were studied. For the first 12 months of superstation operation, the following air quality variables of a priori interest were available: ozone (8-h), NO2 (1-h), SO2 (1-h), CO (1-h), and 24-h measurements of PM10, coarse PM (PM 2.5-10 microm), PM2.5, polar VOCs, 10-100 nm particulate count and surface area, and in the PM2.5 fraction: sulfates, acidity, water-soluble metals, organic matter (OM), and elemental carbon (EC). During the pre-superstation time period, statistically significant, positive associations were observed for adult asthma with ozone, and for COPD with ozone, NO2 and PM10. During the superstation time period, the following statistically significant, positive associations were observed: dysrhythmia with CO, coarse PM, and PM2.5 EC; and all CVDs with CO, PM2.5 EC and PM2.5 OM. While covariation of many of the air quality indices limits the informativeness of this analysis, the study provides one of the first assessments of PM components in relation to ED visits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute exposure to outdoor air pollutants has been associated with increased pediatric asthma morbidity. However, the impact of subchronic exposures is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between subchronic exposure to 6 outdoor air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide) and pediatric asthma hospitalization length of stay, charges, and costs. METHODS: We linked pediatric asthma hospitalization discharge data from a nationally representative dataset, the 1999-2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, with outdoor air pollution data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Hospitals with no air quality data within 10 miles were excluded. Our predictor was the average concentration of 6 pollutants near the hospital during the month of admission. We conducted bivariate analyses using Spearman correlations and multivariable analyses using Poisson regression for length of stay and linear regression for log-transformed charges and costs, controlling for patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and month of admission. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, all 6 pollutants had minimal correlation with the 3 outcomes (ρ<0.1, P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, a 1-unit (μg/m) increase in monthly PM2.5 led to a $123 increase in charges (95% confidence interval $40-249) and a $47 increase in costs (95% confidence interval $15-93). No other pollutants were significant predictors of charges or costs or length of stay. CONCLUSION: Subchronic PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased costs for pediatric asthma hospitalizations. Policy changes to reduce outdoor subchronic pollutant exposure may lead to improved asthma outcomes and substantial savings in healthcare spending.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children may have differing susceptibility to ambient air pollution concentrations depending on various background characteristics of the children. METHODS: Using emergency department (ED) data linked with birth records from Atlanta, Georgia, we identified ED visits for asthma or wheeze among children 2 to 16 years of age from 1 January 2002 through 30 June 2010 (n = 109,758). We stratified by preterm delivery, term low birth weight, maternal race, Medicaid status, maternal education, maternal smoking, delivery method, and history of a bronchiolitis ED visit. Population-weighted daily average concentrations were calculated for 1-hour maximum carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide; 8-hour maximum ozone; and 24-hour average particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and the PM2.5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, and organic carbon, using measurements from stationary monitors. Poisson time-series models were used to estimate rate ratios for associations between 3-day moving average pollutant concentrations and daily ED visit counts and to investigate effect-measure modification by the stratification factors. RESULTS: Associations between pollutant concentrations and asthma exacerbations were larger among children born preterm and among children born to African American mothers. Stratification by race and preterm status together suggested that both factors affected susceptibility. The largest estimated effect size (for an interquartile range increase in pollution) was observed for ozone among preterm births to African American mothers: rate ratio = 1.138 (95% confidence interval = 1.077-1.203). In contrast, the rate ratio for the ozone association among full-term births to mothers of other races was 1.025 (0.970-1.083). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that children vary in their susceptibility to ambient air pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Existing studies of the association between air pollution, aeroallergens and emergency department (ED) visits have generally examined the effects of a few pollutants or aeroallergens on individual conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this study, we considered a wide variety of respiratory and cardiac conditions and an extensive set of pollutants and aeroallergens, and utilized prospectively collected information on possible effect modifiers which would not normally be available from purely administrative data. The association between air pollution, aeroallergens and cardiorespiratory ED visits (n = 19,821) was examined for the period 1992 to 1996 using generalized additive models. ED visit, air pollution and aeroallergen time series were prefiltered using LOESS smoothers to minimize temporal confounding, and a parsimonious model was constructed to control for confounding by weather and day of week. Multipollutant and multi-aeroallergen models were constructed using stepwise procedures and sensitivity analyses were conducted by season, diagnosis, and selected individual characteristics or effect modifiers. In single-pollutant models, positive effects of all pollutants but NO2 and COH were observed on asthma visits, and positive effects on all respiratory diagnosis groups were observed for O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and SO4(2-). Among cardiac conditions, only dysrhythmia visits were positively associated with all measures of particulate matter. In the final year-round multipollutant models, a 20.9% increase in cardiac ED visits was attributed to the combination of O3 (16.0%, 95% CI 2.8-30.9) and SO2 (4.9%, 95%CI 1.7-8.2) at the mean concentration of each pollutant. In the final multipollutant model for respiratory visits, O3 accounted for 3.9% of visits (95% CI 0.8-7.2), and SO2 for 3.7% (95% CI 1.5-6.0), whereas a weak, negative association was observed with NO2. In multi-aeroallergen models of warm season asthma ED visits, Ascomycetes, Alternaria and small round fungal spores accounted for 4.5% (95% CI 1.8-7.4), 4.7% (95% CI 1.0-8.6) and 3.0% (95% CI 0.8-5.1), respectively, of visits at their mean concentrations, and these effects were not sensitive to adjustment for air pollution effects. In conclusion, we observed a significant influence of the air pollution mix on cardiac and respiratory ED visits. Although in single-pollutant models, positive associations were noted between ED visits and some measures of particulate matter, in multipollutant models, pollutant gases, particularly ozone, exhibited more consistent effects. Aeroallergens were also significantly associated with warm season asthma ED visits.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to comprehensively investigate the associations of air pollutants with hospital admissions for critical illness in ED. Patients with critical illness including level 1 and level 2 of the Emergency Severity Index admitted in ED of Changsha Central Hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were enrolled. Meteorological and air pollutants data source were collected from the National Meteorological Science Data Center. A Poisson generalized linear regression combined with a polynomial distributed lag model (PDLM) was utilized to explore the effect of air pollution on hospital admissions for critical illness in ED. Benchmarks as references (25th) were conducted for comparisons with high levels of pollutant concentrations (75th). At first, lagged effects of all different air pollutants were analyzed. Then, based on the most significant factor, analyses in subgroups were performed by gender (male and female), age (< 45, 45-65, and > 65), disorders (cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory), and seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). A total of 47,290 patients with critical illness admitted in ED were included. The effects of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3 and CO) on critical illness ED visits were statistically significant. Strong collinearity between PM2.5 and PM10 (r = 0.862) was found. Both single-day lag and cumulative-day lag day models showed that PM2.5 had the strongest effects (lag 0, RR = 1.025, 95% CI 1.008-1.043, and lag 0-14, RR = 1.067, 95% CI 1.017-1.120, respectively). In both PM2.5 and PM10, the risks of critical illness in male, > 65 ages, respiratory diseases, and winter increased the most significant. Air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and PM10 exposure, could increase the risk of critical illness admission.",

      "abstract": "Longer, more severe wildfire seasons are becoming the norm in fire-prone areas. Prescribed burning is a tool used to mitigate wildfire spread. However, prescribed burning also contributes to air pollution, including PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 µm). While the health impacts of wildfire smoke (WFS) are well-studied, relatively less is known about the effects of prescribed fire smoke (PFS). Our study leverages healthcare claims available for residents of 11 Southeastern US states (2013-2021) to investigate the health impacts associated with PFS. We used a chemical transport model (CTM) and data fusion-based method to estimate county-level outdoor PFS-specific PM2.5 concentrations and employed a time-stratified case-crossover design to quantify the relative risk of emergency department (ED) visits associated with PM2.5 levels lagged 0-3 days. Models adjusted for non-prescribed fire PM2.5 and O3, temperature, humidity, and holidays. We also examined how relative risks varied across population subgroups. PFS-specific PM2.5 was associated with a relative risk of ED visits for non-external causes (1.01, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.02) comparing 4.3 µg/m3 (95th percentile) versus 0 µg/m3, upper respiratory infections (1.04, 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.07), and ischemic heart disease (1.06, 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.11). We did not observe an increased risk for overall respiratory outcomes, asthma, or COPD, which differs from published WFS findings. Relative risks varied across outcomes and modestly across population subgroups defined by age and markers of social vulnerability. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons, these differences were not significant. Some findings differed from associations previously reported elsewhere for WFS, highlighting the need for direct comparisons of the health impacts of WFS versus PFS for evaluating safety of prescribed burning as a fire management tool.",

      "title": "An association between fine particles and asthma emergency department visits for children in Seattle.",
      "abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and its prevalence is increasing, causing much concern for identification of risk factors such as air pollution. We previously conducted a study showing a relationship between asthma visits in all persons < 65 years of age to emergency departments (EDs) and air pollution in Seattle, Washington. In that study the most frequent zip codes of the visits were in the inner city. The Seattle-King County Department of Public Health (Seattle, WA) subsequently published a report which showed that the hospitalization rate for children in the inner city was over 600/100,000, whereas it was < 100/100,000 for children living in the suburbs. Therefore, we conducted the present study to evaluate whether asthma visits to hospital emergency departments in the inner city of Seattle were associated with outdoor air pollution levels. ED visits to six hospitals for asthma and daily air pollution data were obtained for 15 months during 1995 and 1996. The association between air pollution and childhood ED visits for asthma from the inner city area with high asthma hospitalization rates were compared with those from lower hospital utilization areas. Daily ED counts were regressed against fine particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide using a semiparametric Poisson regression model. Significant associations were found between ED visits for asthma in children and fine PM and CO. A change of 11 microg/m3 in fine PM was associated with a relative rate of 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.23]. There was no stronger association between ED visits for asthma and air pollution in the higher hospital utilization area than in the lower utilization area. These findings were seen when estimated PM2.5 concentrations were below the newly adopted annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 15 microg/m3.",

      "title": "Association of particulate matter components with daily mortality and morbidity in urban populations.",
      "abstract": "Indices of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) have been reported to be associated with daily mortality and morbidity in a large number of recent time-series studies. However, the question remains as to which components of PM are responsible for the reported associations. Multiple PM components rarely are measured simultaneously. To investigate PM effects on mortality and morbidity, we used the multiple PM components measured in Windsor, Ontario, at a site only a few miles from downtown Detroit, Michigan. This study focused primarily on two study periods in which multiple PM components were measured in Windsor: 1985 to 1990, when levels of total suspended particles (TSP), sulfate from TSP (TSP-SO4(2-)), PM less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), and nonthoracic TSP (TSP-PM10) were measured throughout the year; and 1992 to 1994, when data on PM10, PM2.5 (PM less than 2.5 microns in diameter), PM10-2.5 (PM10 minus PM2.5), particle acidity (H+), and artifact-free sulfates (SO4(2-)) were available for mostly summer months. Mortality data were analyzed for the 1985 to 1990 study period, and data on both mortality and hospital admissions of elderly patients were analyzed for the 1992 through 1994 period. Poisson regressions were used to estimate the effects of these PM components and gaseous criteria pollutants on mortality (nonaccidental, circulatory, respiratory, and nonaccidental without circulatory and respiratory) and on hospital admissions of elderly patients (for pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], ischemic heart disease, dysrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke), adjusting for temperature and humidity, trends and seasonal cycles, and day of the week. Both PM10 and TSP were associated significantly with respiratory mortality for the 1985 to 1990 period, with similar relative risk (RR) estimates for PM10 (RR = 1.123; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0361-1.218) and TSP (RR = 1.109; 95% CI 1.028-1.197), per 5th to 95th percentile increment. The effect-size estimates for TSP-SO4(2-) and TSP-PM10 were smaller and less significant. In two-pollutant models, simultaneous inclusion of gaseous pollutants with PM10 or TSP reduced PM coefficients by 0 to 34%. The effect-size estimates for total mortality, circulatory mortality, and total minus circulatory and respiratory mortality were less than those for respiratory mortality. Ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) also were associated significantly with total and circulatory mortality, but a simultaneous consideration of these pollutants with PM10 reduced PM10 coefficients only slightly, or even increased them. In these results, pollution coefficients often were positive at multiple lag days (0-day through 3-day lags were examined), but for PM indices, 1-day lag coefficients were most significant. However, when all combinations of multiple-day average exposures were examined, for cases in which multiple lag days were positive, the choice of single-day or multiple-day average exposure did not appreciably change the estimated effect sizes. An examination of temporal correlation showed that the order of spatial uniformity as expressed by the median site-to-site correlation was O3 (0.83), PM10 (0.78), TSP (0.71), NO2 (0.70), carbon monoxide (CO) (0.50), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) (0.49), which suggests less exposure error for O3 and PM10 than for the other measured pollutants. Thus, these results suggest that spatially homogeneous pollution indices show higher associations with measured health outcomes.",

      "title": "Associations Between Hourly Ambient Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Ambulance Emergency Calls: Time-Stratified Case-Crossover Study.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Associations between short-term exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollutants and mortality or hospital admissions have been well-documented in previous studies. Less is known about the associations of hourly exposure to PM air pollutants with ambulance emergency calls (AECs) for all causes and specific causes by conducting a case-crossover study. In addition, different patterns of AECs may be attributed to different seasons and daytime or nighttime periods. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we quantified the risk of all-cause and cause-specific AECs associated with hourly PM air pollutants between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019, in Shenzhen, China. We also examined whether the observed associations of PM air pollutants with AECs for all causes differed across strata defined by sex, age, season, and the time of day. METHODS: We used ambulance emergency dispatch data and environmental data between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019, from the Shenzhen Ambulance Emergency Centre and the National Environmental Monitor Station to conduct a time-stratified case-crossover study to estimate the associations of air pollutants (ie, PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm [PM2.5] or 10 µm [PM10]) with all-cause and cause-specific AECs. We generated a well-established, distributed lag nonlinear model for nonlinear concentration response and nonlinear lag-response functions. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios with 95% CIs, adjusted for public holidays, season, the time of day, the day of the week, hourly temperature, and hourly humidity, to examine the association of all-cause and cause-specific AECs with hourly air pollutant concentrations. RESULTS: A total of 3,022,164 patients were identified during the study period in Shenzhen. Each IQR increase in PM2.5 (24.0 µg/m3) and PM10 (34.0 µg/m3) concentrations over 24 hours was associated with an increased risk of AECs (PM2.5: all-cause, 1.8%, 95% CI 0.8%-2.4%; PM10: all-cause, 2.0%, 95% CI 1.1%-2.9%). We observed a stronger association of all-cause AECs with PM2.5 and PM10 in the daytime than in the nighttime (PM2.5: daytime, 1.7%, 95% CI 0.5%-3.0%; nighttime, 1.4%, 95% CI 0.3%-2.6%; PM10: daytime, 2.1%, 95% CI 0.9%-3.4%; nighttime, 1.7%, 95% CI 0.6%-2.8%) and in the older group than in the younger group (PM2.5: 18-64 years, 1.4%, 95% CI 0.6%-2.1%; ≥65 years, 1.6%, 95% CI 0.6%-2.6%; PM10: 18-64 years, 1.8%, 95% CI 0.9%-2.6%; ≥65 years, 2.0%, 95% CI 1.1%-3.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of all-cause AECs increased consistently with increasing concentrations of PM air pollutants, showing a nearly linear relationship with no apparent thresholds. PM air pollution increase was associated with a higher risk of all-cause AECs and cardiovascular diseases-, respiratory diseases-, and reproductive illnesses-related AECs. The results of this study may be valuable to air pollution attributable to the distribution of emergency resources and consistent air pollution control.",

      "title": "Characterization of PM2.5, gaseous pollutants, and meteorological interactions in the context of time-series health effects models.",
      "abstract": "Associations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone with morbidity and mortality have been reported in many recent observational epidemiology studies. These studies often considered other gaseous co-pollutants also as potential confounders, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). However, because each of these air pollutants can have different seasonal patterns and chemical interactions, the estimation and interpretation of each pollutant's individual risk estimates may not be straightforward. Multi-collinearity among the air pollution and weather variables also leaves the possibility of confounding and over- or under-fitting of meteorological variables, thereby potentially influencing the health effect estimates for the various pollutants in differing ways. To investigate these issues, we examined the temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables in the context of air pollution health effects models. We compiled daily data for PM less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure for New York City for the years 1999-2002. We conducted several sets of analyses to characterize air pollution and weather data interactions, to assess different aspects of these data issues: (1) spatial/temporal variation of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants measured at multiple monitors; (2) temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables; and (3) extent and nature of multi-collinearity of air pollution and weather variables in the context of health effects models. The air pollution variables showed a varying extent of intercorrelations with each other and with weather variables, and these correlations also varied across seasons. For example, NO2 exhibited the strongest negative correlation with wind speed among the pollutants considered, while ozone's correlation with PM2.5 changed signs across the seasons (positive in summer and negative in winter). The extent of multi-collinearity problems also varied across pollutants and choice of health effects models commonly used in the literature. These results indicate that the health effects regression need to be run by season for some pollutants to provide the most meaningful results. We also find that model choice and interpretation needs to take into consideration the varying pollutant concurvities with the model co-variables in each pollutant's health effects model specification. Finally, we provide an example for analysis of associations between these air pollutants and asthma emergency department visits in New York City, which evaluate the relationship between the various pollutants' risk estimates and their respective concurvities, and discuss the limitations that these results imply about the interpretability of multi-pollutant health effects models.",

METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study (2018-2024) using conditional logistic regression to compare emergency department (ED) visits on wildfire smoke versus nonsmoke days. Two PM 2.5 thresholds were used (≥35.4 and ≥20.4 μg/m 3 ). Analyses were adjusted for daily average temperature and lagged exposures (lags 0-7). RESULTS: Both high and moderate PM 2.5 exposures are linked with increased odds of respiratory and behavioral health ED visits at specific lags. Even exposures within the moderate range were associated with increased odds of adverse health events. CONCLUSIONS: Acute wildfire smoke exposure raises concern for increases in ED visits among an otherwise healthy military population, highlighting the need for on-base air quality monitoring and targeted risk mitigation.",

However, information is limited concerning associations between ambient air zinc levels and health care utilization for asthma, especially among children. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between outdoor ambient air PM(2.5) zinc levels and urgent health care utilization for children living in an urban area. METHODS: We used a time-series study to estimate the association of ambient air PM(2.5) zinc levels with hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) utilization by children in Baltimore, Maryland, controlling for time trends. We used data from daily discharge administrative claims of ED and hospital utilization for asthma in children, 0-17 years of age for Greater Baltimore from June 2002 through November 2002. We collected ambient air PM(2.5) metal concentration data, determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Baltimore Supersite project. RESULTS: Previous-day medium levels of zinc (8.63-20.76 ng/m(3)) are associated with risks of pediatric asthma exacerbations that are 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.41) times higher than those with previous-day low levels of zinc (<8.63 ng/m(3)) after accounting for time-varying potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that high ambient air PM(2.5) zinc levels are associated with an increase in ED visits/hospital admissions for asthma on the following day among children living in an urban area.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Western Montana, USA, experiences complex air pollution patterns with predominant exposure sources from summer wildfire smoke and winter wood smoke. In addition, climate change related temperatures events are becoming more extreme and expected to contribute to increases in hospital admissions for a range of health outcomes. Few studies have evaluated these exposures (air pollution and temperature) that often occur simultaneously and may act synergistically on health. METHODS: We explored short-term exposure to air pollution on childhood respiratory health outcomes and how extreme temperature or seasonal period modify the risk of air pollution-associated hospitalizations. The main outcome measure included all respiratory-related hospital admissions for three categories: asthma, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) across western Montana for all individuals aged 0-17 from 2017-2020. We used a time-stratified, case-crossover analysis and distributed lag models to identify sensitive exposure windows of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) lagged from 0 (same-day) to 15 prior-days modified by temperature or season. RESULTS: Short-term exposure increases of 1 μg/m3 in PM2.5 were associated with elevated odds of all three respiratory hospital admission categories. PM2.5 was associated with the largest increased odds of hospitalizations for asthma at lag 7-13 days [1.87(1.17-2.97)], for LRTI at lag 6-12 days [2.18(1.20-3.97)], and for URTI at a cumulative lag of 13 days [1.29(1.07-1.57)]. The impact of PM2.5 varied by temperature and season for each respiratory outcome scenario. For asthma, PM2.5 was associated most strongly during colder temperatures [3.11(1.40-6.89)] and the winter season [3.26(1.07-9.95)]. Also in colder temperatures, PM2.5 was associated with increased odds of LRTI hospitalization [2.61(1.15-5.94)], but no seasonal effect was observed. Finally, 13 days of cumulative PM2.5 prior to admissions date was associated with the greatest increased odds of URTI hospitalization during summer days [3.35(1.85-6.04)] and hotter temperatures [1.71(1.31-2.22)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children's respiratory-related hospital admissions were associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5. PM2.5 associations with asthma and LRTI hospitalizations were strongest during cold periods, whereas associations with URTI were largest during hot periods.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence of association of ambient air pollution with cause-specific emergency department visits in China is still limited. This study aimed to investigate short-term associations between exposures to air pollutants and daily cause-specific emergency department visits using a large-scale multicenter database involving a total of 65 sentinel hospitals in Guangzhou, the most densely-populated city in south China, during 2013-2015. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained data on 162,771 emergency department visits from 65 hospitals from the Emergency Medical Command Center in Guangzhou between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. Daily air pollution data on particulate matter (PM) of aerodynamic diameter<10 and 2.5μm (PM10, and PM2.5, respectively), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) were collected from the Daily Quality Report of the Guangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau during the study period. Visits for neurologic, respiratory and circulatory diseases were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized additive models. RESULTS: Mean daily number of emergency department visits for neurologic, respiratory and circulatory diseases was 89, 24 and 35, respectively. After adjustment for other pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3), meteorological factors and time-varying confounders, a 7.98-μg/m3 (interquartile range) increment in 2-day moving average of same-day and previous-day SO2 concentrations was associated with the statistically significant increase of 4.89% (95% confidence interval: 2.86, 6.95) in neurologic emergency department visits; elevation in SO2 level (per 7.98μg/m3) was linked to a 5.19% (95% confidence interval: 2.03, 8.44) increase in circulatory emergency department visits. Most positive links were seen during the cold season. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study contribute to the evidence of the significant associations between SO2 and specific neurologic and circulatory conditions, and also provide insight into the planning of clinical services and emergency contingency response for air pollution exposures in Guangzhou.",

      "abstract": "Traditional environmental public health surveillance consists of separately measuring hazards, exposures, and health outcomes. The Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Network seeks to accrue additional information by linking hazard or exposure data to health outcomes data. A natural progression is to consider tracking the \"link\" itself, that is, to track the association between an environmental hazard and a health outcome. The Maine EPHT Program conducted a case-crossover analysis to measure associations between daily estimated ambient ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) and asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits for 2000-2003. We found an overall association of 7 percent (95% confidence interval, 4-11) excess asthma-related ED visits per 10-ppb increase in ozone averaged over 4 days (lag 0-3). The association was positive in the first 3 years and negative in the last. The excess risk was concentrated among females aged 15 to 34 and males younger than 15. The methodology for tracking associations between ambient air quality and acute morbidity is not generalizable to most other EPHT topic areas, but there are ample reasons to pursue this activity. The analysis can potentially help evaluate the effectiveness of regulatory and intervention programs, as well as inform us about trends, sensitive subpopulations, and changing potency of air constituents.",

      "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Recent studies have proposed also a link with venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. This study was aimed to evaluate the possible influence of air pollution-related changes on the daily flux of patients referring to the Emergency Department (ED) for VTE, dissecting the different effects of coarse and fine PM. From July 1(st), 2007, to June 30(th), 2009, data about ED accesses for VTE and about daily concentrations of PM air pollution in Verona district (Italy) were collected. Coarse PM (PM(10-2.5)) was calculated by subtracting the finest PM(2.5) from the whole PM(10). During the index period a total of 302 accesses for VTE were observed (135 males and 167 females; mean age 68.3 ± 16.7 years). In multiple regression models adjusted for other atmospheric parameters PM(10-2.5), but not PM(2.5), concentrations were positively correlated with VTE (beta-coefficient = 0.237; P = 0.020). During the days with high levels of PM(10-2.5) (≥ 75(th) percentile) there was an increased risk of ED accesses for VTE (OR 1.69 with 95%CI 1.13-2.53). By analysing days of exposure using distributed lag non-linear models, the increase of VTE risk was limited to PM(10-2.5) peaks in the short-term period. Consistently with these results, in another cohort of subjects without active thrombosis (n = 102) an inverse correlation between PM(10-2.5) and prothrombin time was found (R = -0.247; P = 0.012). Our results suggest that short-time exposure to high concentrations of PM(10-2.5) may favour an increased rate of ED accesses for VTE through the induction of a prothrombotic state.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine healthcare service utilisation for cardiorespiratory presentations and outpatient salbutamol dispensation associated with 2.5 months of severe, unabating wildfire smoke in Canada's high subarctic. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using hospital, clinic, pharmacy and environmental data analysed using Poisson regression. SETTING: Territorial referral hospital and clinics in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals from Yellowknife and surrounding communities presenting for care between 2012 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergency room (ER) presentations, hospital admissions and clinic visits for cardiorespiratory events, and outpatient salbutamol prescriptions RESULTS: The median 24-hour mean particulate matter (PM2.5) was fivefold higher in the summer of 2014 compared with 2012, 2013 and 2015 (median=30.8 µg/m3), with the mean peaking at 320.3 µg/m3. A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an increase in asthma-related (incidence rate ratio (IRR) (95% CI): 1.11 (1.07, 1.14)) and pneumonia-related ER visits (IRR (95% CI): 1.06 (1.02, 1.10)), as well as an increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalisations (IRR (95% CI): 1.11 (1.02, 1.20). Compared with 2012 and 2013, salbutamol dispensations in 2014 increased by 48%; clinic visits for asthma, pneumonia and cough increased; ER visits for asthma doubled, with the highest rate in females, in adults aged ≥40 years and in Dene people, while pneumonia increased by 57%, with higher rates in males, in individualsaged <40 years and in Inuit people. Cardiac variables were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Severe wildfires in 2014 resulted in extended poor air quality associated with increases in health resource utilization; some impacts were seen disproportionately among vulnerable populations, such as children and Indigenous individuals. Public health advisories asking people to stay inside were inadequately protective, with compliance possibly impacted by the prolonged exposure. Future research should investigate use of at-home air filtration systems, clean-air shelters and public health messaging which addresses mental health and supports physical activity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5, NO2, mortality and morbidity in New Zealand, a country with low levels of exposure. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The New Zealand resident population. METHOD: The main analyses included all adults aged 30 years and over with complete data on covariates: N = 2,223,507. People who died, or were admitted to hospital, (2013-2016) were linked anonymously to the 2013 census, and to estimates of ambient PM2.5, and NO2 concentration. We fitted Poisson regression models of mortality and morbidity in adults (≥30) for all natural causes of death, and by sub- group of major cause. Person-time of exposure, censored at the time of death, was included as an offset. We adjusted for confounding by age, sex, ethnicity, income, education, smoking status and ambient temperature. Further analyses stratified by ethnic group, and investigated respiratory hospital admissions in children. RESULTS: There were statistically significant positive associations between pollutants and natural causes of death: RR (per 10 μg/m3) for PM2.5 1.11 (1.07 to 1.15) and for NO2 1.10 (1.07 to 1.12). For morbidity, the strongest associations were for PM2.5 and ischaemic heart disease in adults, RR: 1.29 (1.23 to 1.35) and for NO2 and asthma in children, RR: 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28). In models restricted to specific ethnic groups, we found no consistent differences in any of the associations. CONCLUSIONS: The results for NO2 are higher than those published previously. Other studies have reported that the dose-response for PM2.5 may be higher at low concentrations, but less is known about NO2. It is possible NO2 is acting as a proxy for other traffic-related pollutants that are causally related to health impacts. This study underlines the importance of controlling pollution caused by motor vehicles.",

      "abstract": "The fine particulate matter baseline (PMB), which includes PM2.5 monitor readings fused with Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model predictions, using the Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM), is less accurate in rural areas without monitors. To address this issue, an upgraded HBM was used to form four experimental aerosol optical depth (AOD)-PM2.5 concentration surfaces. A case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression evaluated the contribution of the AOD-PM2.5 surfaces and PMB to four respiratory-cardiovascular hospital events in all 99 12 km2 CMAQ grids, and in grids with and without ambient air monitors. For all four health outcomes, only two AOD-PM2.5 surfaces, one not kriged (PMC) and the other kriged (PMCK), had significantly higher Odds Ratios (ORs) on lag days 0, 1, and 01 than PMB in all grids, and in grids without monitors. In grids with monitors, emergency department (ED) asthma PMCK on lag days 0, 1 and 01 and inpatient (IP) heart failure (HF) PMCK ORs on lag days 01 were significantly higher than PMB ORs. Warm season ORs were significantly higher than cold season ORs. Independent confirmation of these results should include AOD-PM2.5 concentration surfaces with greater temporal-spatial resolution, now easily available from geostationary satellites, such as GOES-16 and GOES-17.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution is known to affect asthma symptoms in controlled and epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ozone exposure in Seattle is associated with increased use of hospital emergency departments. METHODS: Hospital data on daily asthma cases for all ages were obtained for 1998 through 2002. Ozone and fine particulate matter (< or = 2.5 microm in diameter) (PM2.5) data were obtained from local air agencies. Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between asthma visits to emergency departments and air pollutants. Maximum daily 1- and 8-hour average ozone concentrations and the daily PM2.5 concentration were used. RESULTS: We observed associations between both ozone metrics and emergency department visits in children. For the maximum daily 1- and 8-hour average ozone concentrations, the relative risks (RRs) were 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.18) and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.21), respectively, at 3 days' lag. Weaker but significant associations were also observed for adults. For the maximum daily 1-hour average ozone concentration, the RR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11) at 4 days' lag, and for the maximum daily 8-hour average ozone concentration, the RR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.12) at 2 days' lag and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.14) at 4 days' lag. CONCLUSION: Ozone exposure exacerbates asthma in people in the Seattle area, especially in children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A broad literature base provides evidence of association between air pollution and paediatric asthma. Socioeconomic status (SES) may modify these associations; however, previous studies have found inconsistent evidence regarding the role of SES. METHODS: Effect modification of air pollution-paediatric asthma morbidity by multiple indicators of neighbourhood SES was examined in Atlanta, Georgia. Emergency department (ED) visit data were obtained for 5-18 years old with a diagnosis of asthma in 20-county Atlanta during 2002-2008. Daily ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter and elemental carbon were estimated using ambient monitoring data and emissions-based chemical transport model simulations. Pollutant-asthma associations were estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for temporal trends and meteorology. Effect modification by ZCTA-level (neighbourhood) SES was examined via stratification. RESULTS: We observed stronger air pollution-paediatric asthma associations in 'deprivation areas' (eg, ≥20% of the ZCTA population living in poverty) compared with 'non-deprivation areas'. When stratifying analyses by quartiles of neighbourhood SES, ORs indicated stronger associations in the highest and lowest SES quartiles and weaker associations among the middle quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neighbourhood-level SES is a factor contributing vulnerability to air pollution-related paediatric asthma morbidity in Atlanta. Children living in low SES environments appear to be especially vulnerable given positive ORs and high underlying asthma ED rates. Inconsistent findings of effect modification among previous studies may be partially explained by choice of SES stratification criteria, and the use of multiplicative models combined with differing baseline risk across SES populations.",

      "abstract": "The standard approach to government-mandated aerometric monitoring of airborne particulates across North America is to sample every sixth day year round. However, such data are inadequate for epidemiological studies which aim to examine daily time series relationships of particulate air pollution to respiratory health responses. The aim of the present study was to estimate missing daily particulate matter < or = 2.5 and < or = 10 microns in aerometric diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulfate (SO4(2-) to a degree sufficiently accurate and reliable to allow the use of these estimates, along with the measured data, in an investigation of the relationship of air pollution to respiratory hospital admissions in Montreal during the 1980s. Prediction equations were developed for May through October periods using available daily levels of predictor variables which included: relative humidity-corrected light extinction coefficient (bext) derived from airport visual range sightings, coefficient of haze (COH), SO2, NOx, CO, O3, wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure (BP), temperature, relative humidity, and total precipitation. Three fourths of the available gravimetric particulate data were used to develop prediction models, while the remaining fourth was used to test the reliability of the model (holdout data). All final models explained over 70% of the variability in the particulate air pollutants and were reliable when tested against the holdout data. The strongest (P < 0.001) and most consistent predictors were bext, COH, and O3 measured on the same day as the particulate, and BP lagged 1 day in the past. Other selected variables were same day NOx, BP, and minimum temperature. Although the present approach to the estimation of missing particulate air pollution may increase the level of exposure misclassification, it does allow for the use of existing network databases in epidemiological studies of daily air pollution health effects even though particulate data is only measured on certain days.",

      "title": "Emergency department visits in California associated with wildfire PM",
      "abstract": "The threats to human health from wildfires and wildfire smoke (WFS) in the United States (US) are increasing due to continued climate change. A growing body of literature has documented important adverse health effects of WFS exposure, but there is insufficient evidence regarding how risk related to WFS exposure varies across individual or community level characteristics. To address this evidence gap, we utilized a large nationwide database of healthcare utilization claims for emergency department (ED) visits in California across multiple wildfire seasons (May through November, 2012-2019) and quantified the health impacts of fine particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) air pollution attributable to WFS, overall and among subgroups of the population. We aggregated daily counts of ED visits to the level of the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and used a time-stratified case-crossover design and distributed lag non-linear models to estimate the association between WFS and relative risk of ED visits. We further assessed how the association with WFS varied across subgroups defined by age, race, social vulnerability, and residential air conditioning (AC) prevalence. Over a 7 day period, PM2.5 from WFS was associated with elevated risk of ED visits for all causes (1.04% (0.32%, 1.71%)), non-accidental causes (2.93% (2.16%, 3.70%)), and respiratory disease (15.17% (12.86%, 17.52%)), but not with ED visits for cardiovascular diseases (1.06% (-1.88%, 4.08%)). Analysis across subgroups revealed potential differences in susceptibility by age, race, and AC prevalence, but not across subgroups defined by ZCTA-level Social Vulnerability Index scores. These results suggest that PM2.5 from WFS is associated with higher rates of all cause, non-accidental, and respiratory ED visits with important heterogeneity across certain subgroups. Notably, lower availability of residential AC was associated with higher health risks related to wildfire activity.",

      "abstract": "Alaskan wildfires have major ecological, social, and economic consequences, but associated health impacts remain unexplored. We estimated cardiorespiratory morbidity associated with wildfire smoke (WFS) fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in three major population centers (Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley) during the 2015-2019 wildfire seasons. To estimate WFS PM2.5, we utilized data from ground-based monitors and satellite-based smoke plume estimates. We implemented time-stratified case-crossover analyses with single and distributed lag models to estimate the effect of WFS PM2.5 on cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits. On the day of exposure to WFS PM2.5, there was an increased odds of asthma-related ED visits among 15-65 year olds (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.16), people >65 years (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.31), among Alaska Native people (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.23), and in Anchorage (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.15) and Fairbanks (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.17). There was an increased risk of heart failure related ED visits for Alaska Native people (Lag Day 5 OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.25). We found evidence that rural populations may delay seeking care. As the frequency and magnitude of Alaskan wildfires continue to increase due to climate change, understanding the health impacts will be imperative. A nuanced understanding of the effects of WFS on specific demographic and geographic groups facilitates data-driven public health interventions and fire management protocols that address these adverse health effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between PM2.5 levels and emergency department (ED) visits for selected health outcomes in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during the Wallow fire of 2011. DESIGN: Measurements of 24-hour average concentrations of PM2.5 obtained from the City of Albuquerque were used to calculate wildfire smoke exposure in Albuquerque. Daily ED visits were collected by the New Mexico Department of Health from individual nonfederal licensed facilities in the Albuquerque area. Poisson regression was used to assess the relationship between ED visits for selected respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and varying levels of PM2.5 exposure. SETTING: Albuquerque, New Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Patients visiting an ED for select conditions before, during, and after the wildfire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative increase in ED visits for selected conditions during the wildfire period. RESULTS: Analysis of PM2.5 exposure data and ED visits in Albuquerque before and during the Wallow fire indicated that compared with the period prior to the fire, there was an increased risk of ED visits for some respiratory and cardiovascular conditions during heavy smoke conditions, and risk varied by age and sex. The population of 65+ years was especially at risk for increased ED visits. There was a significantly increased risk of ED visits among the 65+ population for asthma (RR [relative rate] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-2.93) and for diseases of the veins, lymphatic and circulatory system (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.00-2.43). For the age group of 20 to 64 years, there was a statistically significant increase in ED visits for diseases of pulmonary circulation (RR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.42-4.9) and for cerebrovascular disease (RR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.03-2.77). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of PM2.5 exposure due to the Wallow fire were associated with increased ED visits for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in Albuquerque. More effective and targeted preventive measures are necessary to reduce morbidity rates associated with wildfire smoke exposure among vulnerable populations.",

We analyzed data from a tertiary hospital in Xinjiang (2014-2023), along with air pollutant and meteorological data. Using a time-series approach with generalized additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models, we found that interquartile range increases in PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, CO, and O₃ were associated with increased AECOPD admissions of 4.70% (95% CI: 1.48%, 8.01%), 1.61% (0.38%, 2.86%), 15.97% (7.36%, 25.28%), 35.64% (15.84%, 58.82%), and 5.89% (1.10%, 10.90%), respectively, with peak effects at lag 0. Stratified analyses identified sex-, age-, and season-specific relationships, including protective effects of O₃ and CO in males at longer lags, heightened susceptibility to particulate matter and NO₂ in adults aged ≥65 years, and distinct seasonal patterns for NO₂, O₃, and CO. These findings demonstrate that short-term air pollution exposure is significantly associated with AECOPD hospitalizations in this understudied region.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Landscape fires (LFs) are the main source of elevated particulate matter (PM2.5) in Australian cities and towns. This study examined the associations between daily exposure to fine PM2.5 during LF events and daily emergency department attendances (EDA) for all causes, respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: Daily PM2.5 was estimated using a model that included PM2.5 measurements on the previous day, remotely sensed aerosols and fires, hand-drawn tracing of smoke plumes from satellite images, fire danger ratings and the atmosphere venting index. Daily PM2.5 was then categorised as high (≥99th percentile), medium (96th-98th percentile) and low (≤95th percentile). Daily EDA for all-cause and cardiorespiratory conditions were obtained from the Western Australian Emergency Department Data Collection. We used population-based cohort time-series multivariate regressions with 95% CIs to assess modelled daily PM2.5 and EDA associations from 2015 to 2017. We estimated the lag-specific associations and cumulative risk ratios (RR) at lags of 0-3 days, adjusted for sociodemographic factors, weather and time. RESULTS: All-cause EDA and overall cardiovascular presentations increased on all lagged days and up to 5% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.06) and 7% (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12), respectively, at the high level. High-level exposure was also associated with increased acute lower respiratory tract infections at 1 (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.29) and 3 (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.23) days lags and transient ischaemic attacks at 1 day (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.53) and 2 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42) days lag. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 concentrations during LFs was associated with an increased risk of all-cause EDA, overall EDA cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory tract infections and transient ischaemic attacks.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Wildfire smoke harms health. We add to this literature by evaluating the health effects of California's 2018 Carr Fire and preceding wildfire seasons in Shasta County. METHODS: With data from the Shasta County Health and Human Services Agency, we examined the link between weekly wildfire fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure estimated using a spatiotemporal multiple imputation approach and emergency department (ED) visits and mortality using time-series models that controlled for temporal trends and temperature. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2018, Shasta County experienced 19 weeks with average wildfire PM2.5 ≥5.5 μg/m3 (hereafter, \"high wildfire PM2.5 concentration\"). Among all Shasta County Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs; n = 36), we detected no association between high wildfire PM2.5 concentrations and respiratory or circulatory disease-related ED visits or mortality. Subsequent analyses were confined to valley ZCTAs (n = 11, lower elevation, majority of population, worse air quality in general). In valley ZCTAs, high wildfire PM2.5 was associated with a 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2, 24.9) increase in same-week respiratory disease-related ED visits but no increase in the subsequent 2 weeks nor on circulatory disease-related mortality or ED visits or all-cause mortality. Two weeks after high wildfire PM2.5 weeks, respiratory disease-related deaths decreased (-31.5%, 95% CI = -64.4, 1.5). The 2018 Carr Fire appeared to increase respiratory disease-related ED visits by 27.0% (95% CI = 4.0, 50.0) over expectation and possibly reduce circulatory disease-related deaths (-18.2%, 95% CI = -39.4, 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: As climate change fuels wildfire seasons, studies must continue to evaluate their health effects, particularly in highly exposed populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution is leading risk factor for health burden in China. Few studies in China have investigated the economic loss related to short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, which could trigger acute onset of cardiorespiratory diseases within a few days. METHODS: Daily ambient air pollutants data are obtained for each city from the National Air Quality Monitoring System and daily hospitalization data are obtained from the urban employee-based basic medical insurance scheme database in 74 Chinese cities with an average coverage of 88.5 million urban employees during 2016-2017. A three-stage time-series analytic approach is used in this study to investigate the impact of short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution on hospital admissions, expenses and hospital stays of three cause-specific cardiorespiratory diseases, including lower respiratory infections (LRI), coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the included cities. FINDINGS: Based on the time-series analysis using daily hospitalization data, 28,560 LRI cases, 54,600 CHD cases, and 23,989 stroke cases are attributable to ambient PM2.5 in the 74 cities during the study period, and the related attributable expenses are 220 million CNY (US$ 32.9 million) for LRI, 458 million CNY (US$ 68.5 million) for CHD, and 410 million CNY (US$ 65.8 million) for stroke, respectively. These attributable numbers account for 1.45% to 2.05% of total hospital admissions and 1.10% to 1.51% of total expenses for the three diseases during 2016-2017, respectively. The attributable numbers for the three cause-specific cardiorespiratory diseases would increase to 362,007 hospital admission cases and 3.68 billion CNY expenses ($US550 million) in the entire urban employee population (299 million) in China during 2016-2017, and the related direct economic loss of absence from work would be 798 million CNY (US$ 119.3 million). INTERPRETATION: Our results support that short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution could lead to significant health and economic impacts in China. Reducing levels of ambient PM2.5 can avoid substantial health damage and expenditures, and generate appreciable economic benefits from decreasing absence from work.

      "abstract": "Optimal use of Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM)-assembled aerosol optical depth (AOD)-PM2.5 fused surfaces in epidemiologic studies requires homogeneous temporal and spatial fused surfaces. No analytical method is available to evaluate spatial heterogeneity. The temporal case-crossover design was modified to assess the spatial association between four experimental AOD-PM2.5 fused surfaces and four respiratory-cardiovascular hospital events in 12 km2 grids. The maximum number of adjacent lag grids with significant odds ratios (ORs) identified homogeneous spatial areas (HOSAs). The largest HOSA included five grids (lag grids 04; 720 km2) and the smallest HOSA contained two grids (lag grids 01; 288 km2). Emergency department asthma and inpatient asthma, myocardial infarction, and heart failure ORs were significantly higher in rural grids without air monitors than in urban grids with air monitors at lag grids 0, 1, and 01. Rural grids had higher AOD-PM2.5 concentration levels, population density, and poverty percentages than urban grids. Warm season ORs were significantly higher than cold season ORs for all health outcomes at lag grids 0, 1, 01, and 04. The possibility of elevated fine and ultrafine PM and other demographic and environmental risk factors synergistically contributing to elevated respiratory-cardiovascular chronic diseases in persons residing in rural areas was discussed.",

      "abstract": "Many epidemiologic studies concerned with acute exposure to ambient PM2.5 have reported positive associations for respiratory disease hospitalization. However, few studies have investigated this relationship in Kuwait and extrapolating results from other regions may involve considerable uncertainty due to variations in concentration levels, particle sources and composition, and population characteristics. Local studies can provide evidence for strategies to reduce risks from episodic exposures to high levels of ambient PM2.5 and generating hypotheses for evaluating health risks from chronic exposures. Therefore, using speciated PM2.5 data from local samplers, we analyzed the impact of daily total and source-specific PM2.5 exposure on respiratory hospitalizations in Kuwait using a case-crossover design with conditional quasi-Poisson regression. Total and source-specific ambient PM2.5 were modeled using 0-5-day cumulative distributed lags. For total PM2.5, we observed a 0.16% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05, 0.27%) increase in risk for respiratory hospitalization per 1 μg/m3 increase in concentration. Of the source factors assessed, dust demonstrated a statistically significant increase in risk (0.16%, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.29%), and the central estimate for regional PM2.5 was positive (0.11%) but not statistically significant (95% CI = -0.11, 0.33%). No effect was observed from traffic emissions and 'other' source factors. When hospitalizations were stratified by sex, nationality, and age, we found that female, Kuwaiti national, and adult groups had higher effect estimates. These results suggest that exposure to ambient PM2.5 is harmful in Kuwait and provide some evidence of differential toxicity and effect modification depending on the PM2.5 source and population affected.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Today, air pollution is one of the critical problems in metropolitans and necessary preparations are needed for confronting this crisis. The present study was based on the goal of determining the relationship of air pollutant levels with the rate of emergency admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular patients. METHODS: In the present retrospective cross-sectional study, all respiratory and cardiovascular patients, referred to emergency department during 2012, were assessed. The meteorological and air pollution data were collected. Information regarding the numbers and dates (month, day) of admission for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases was achieved from the hospital's electronic registration system. The relation of air pollution and respiratory and cardiovascular admissions were analyzed by generalize additive model (GAM). RESULTS: 5922 patients were assessed which included 4048 (68.36%) cardiovascular and 1874 (31.64%) respiratory. Carbon monoxide (CO) level was an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease on the same day (RR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.25- 1.77; P<0.001), the day before (RR=1.22; 95% CI: 1.02- 1.45; P=0.03), and the last two days (RR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.09- 1.54; P<0.001). The same process was repeated for ozone (O3). In addition, the O3 level on the same day (RR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.25- 1.77; P<0.001), the day before (RR=1.22; 95% CI: 1.02- 1.45; P=0.03), the last two days (RR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.09- 1.54; P<0.001), and the last week (RR=1.004; 95% CI: 1.0007-1.008; P=0.02) were independent risk factors of respiratory admissions. The increased level of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) like O3 led to growth in the admissions to emergency department. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggested that rising levels of CO and O3 during two days leads to a significant increase in cardiovascular admission on the third day. Furthermore, increase in O3, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and CO levels causes a rise in respiratory admissions to emergency department.",

      "title": "Spatial Heterogeneity of the Respiratory Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke PM",
      "abstract": "Wildfire smoke fine particles (PM2.5) are a growing public health threat as wildfire events become more common and intense under climate change, especially in the Western United States. Studies assessing the association between wildfire PM2.5 exposure and health typically summarize the effects over the study area. However, health responses to wildfire PM2.5 may vary spatially. We evaluated spatially-varying respiratory acute care utilization risks associated with short-term exposure to wildfire PM2.5 and explored community characteristics possibly driving spatial heterogeneity. Using ensemble-modeled daily wildfire PM2.5, we defined a wildfire smoke day to have wildfire-specific PM2.5 concentration ≥15 μg/m3. We included daily respiratory emergency department visits and unplanned hospitalizations in 1,396 California ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and 15 census-derived community characteristics. Employing a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we observed increased odds of respiratory acute care utilization on wildfire smoke days at the state level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.07). Across air basins, ORs ranged from 0.88 to 1.57, with the highest effect estimate in San Diego. A within-community matching design and spatial Bayesian hierarchical model also revealed spatial heterogeneity in ZCTA-level rate differences. For example, communities with a higher percentage of Black or Pacific Islander residents had stronger wildfire PM2.5-outcome relationships, while more air conditioning and tree canopy attenuated associations. We found an important heterogeneity in wildfire smoke-related health impacts across air basins, counties, and ZCTAs, and we identified characteristics of vulnerable communities, providing evidence to guide policy development and resource allocation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Global asthma-related mortality tallies at around 2.5 million annually. Although asthma may be triggered or exacerbated by particulate matter (PM) exposure, studies investigating the relationship of PM and its components with emergency department (ED) visits for pediatric asthma are limited. This study aimed to estimate the impact of short-term exposure to PM constituents on ED visits for pediatric asthma. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated non-trauma patients aged younger than 17 years who visited the ED with a primary diagnosis of asthma. Further, measurements of PM with aerodynamic diameter of < 10 μm (PM10), PM with aerodynamic diameter of < 10 μm (PM2.5), and four PM2.5 components (i.e., nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)) were collected between 2007 and 2010 from southern particulate matter supersites. These included one core station and two satellite stations in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted to analyze the hazard effect of PM. RESULTS: Overall, 1597 patients were enrolled in our study. In the single-pollutant model, the estimated risk increase for pediatric asthma incidence on lag 3 were 14.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2-27.4%], 13.5% (95% CI, 3.3-24.6%), 14.8% (95% CI, 2.5-28.6%), and 19.8% (95% CI, 7.6-33.3%) per interquartile range increments in PM2.5, PM10, nitrate, and OC, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, OC remained significant after adjusting for PM2.5, PM10, and nitrate. During subgroup analysis, children were more vulnerable to PM2.5 and OC during cold days (< 26 °C, interaction p = 0.008 and 0.012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both PM2.5 concentrations and its chemical constituents OC and nitrate are associated with ED visits for pediatric asthma. Among PM2.5 constituents, OC was most closely related to ED visits for pediatric asthma, and children are more vulnerable to PM2.5 and OC during cold days.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term increases in air pollution are associated with poor asthma and COPD outcomes. Short-term elevations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) due to wildfire smoke are becoming more common. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are short-term increases in PM2.5 and ozone in wildfire season and in winter inversion season associated with a composite of emergency or inpatient hospitalization for asthma and COPD? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Case-crossover analyses evaluated 63,976 and 18,514 patients hospitalized for primary discharge diagnoses of asthma and COPD, respectively, between January 1999 and March 2022. Patients resided on Utah's Wasatch Front where PM2.5 and ozone were measured by Environmental Protection Agency-based monitors. ORs were calculated using Poisson regression adjusted for weather variables. RESULTS: Asthma risk increased on the same day that PM2.5 increased during wildfire season (OR, 1.057 per + 10 μg/m3; 95% CI, 1.019-1.097; P = .003) and winter inversions (OR, 1.023 per +10 μg/m3; 95% CI, 1.010-1.037; P = .0004). Risk decreased after 1 week, but during wildfire season risk rebounded at a 4-week lag (OR, 1.098 per +10 μg/m3; 95% CI, 1.033-1.167). Asthma risk for adults during wildfire season was highest in the first 3 days after PM2.5 increases, but for children, the highest risk was delayed by 3 to 4 weeks. PM2.5 exposure was weakly associated with COPD hospitalization. Ozone exposure was not associated with elevated risks. INTERPRETATION: In a large urban population, short-term increases in PM2.5 during wildfire season were associated with asthma hospitalization, and the effect sizes were greater than for PM2.5 during inversion season.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Associations between PM2.5 and the risk of asthma admission have been established in previous researches. However, evidence about the specific impacts of PM2.5 components on asthma-related hospitalizations across different populations and environments is limited and inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between short-term exposure PM2.5 and its components with asthma hospital admission. METHOD: A total of 930 people hospitalized for asthma were included in the study in Shanghai between December 2018 and December 2022. Air pollution data were assigned to individuals based on their residential address using the Tracking Air Pollution (TAP) platform. A time-stratified case-crossover design and a conditional logistic regression model were used to estimate the risk of asthma admissions related to exposure to PM2.5. We also conducted stratified analyzes by age, gender, and season. RESULTS: Each 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5, BC, NO3-, NH4+, SO42- and OM at lag-5 day were associated with increased risk of asthma admission, with ORs of 1.04(1.00,1.08), 2.59(0.99,6.76), 1.17(1.02,1.33), 1.33(1.06,1.66), 1.28(1.05,1.55) and 1.16(0.98,1.37), respectively. Stratified analysis showed that PM2.5 and its components had a more significant impact on the risk of asthma admission for women; individuals aged ≥ 65 years, and during cold seasons at lag-5 day. The results remained stable in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to PM2.5 and its components (NO3-, NH4+, SO42-) increases hospitalization risk in asthma patients, particularly among women, elder and those admitted during cold seasons. It provides new insight for reducing the asthma burden associated with particulate air pollution.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the interrupting effect of social distancing (SD) on emergency department (ED) patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, asthma, and suicide attempts by PM2.5 exposure in eight Korean megacities from 2017 to 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used National Emergency Department Information System and AirKorea data. A total of 469014 patients visited EDs from 2017 to 2020. Interrupted time series analysis was employed to examine changes in the level and slope of the time series, relative risk, and confidence intervals (CIs) by PM2.5 exposure. The SD level was added to the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The interrupted time series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the ratio of relative risk (RRR) of IHD patients in Seoul (RRR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.006) and Busan (RRR=1.007, 95% CI: 1.002, 1.012) post-SD. Regarding stroke, only patients in Seoul exhibited a significant decrease post-SD (RRR=0.995, 95% CI: 0.991, 0.999). No significant changes were observed for asthma in any of the cities. In the case of suicide attempts, Ulsan demonstrated substantial pre-SD (RR=0.827, 95% CI: 0.732, 0.935) and post-SD (RRR=1.200, 95% CI: 1.057, 1.362) differences. CONCLUSION: While the interrupting effect of SD was not as pronounced as anticipated, this study did validate the effectiveness of SD in modifying health behaviors and minimizing avoidable visits to EDs in addition to curtailing the occurrence of infectious diseases.",

      "title": "Association of daily asthma emergency department visits and hospital admissions with ambient air pollutants among the pediatric Medicaid population in Detroit: time-series and time-stratified case-crossover analyses with threshold effects.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies. In such study designs, threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have been relatively unexplored, which are of potential interest for exploring concentration-response relationships. METHODS: This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population (ages 2-18 years) of Detroit, Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles (PM2.5), CO, NO2 and SO2 for the 2004-2006 period, using both time-series and case-crossover designs. We use a simple, testable and readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate threshold parameters in both designs. RESULTS: Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events was found for SO2 and PM2.5, and a significant threshold effect was estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11 μg m(-3) using generalized additive models and conditional logistic regression models, respectively. Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared to standard linear relationship, e.g., in the time series analysis, an interquartile range increase (9.2 μg m(-3)) in PM2.5 (5-day-moving average) had a risk ratio of 1.030 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.061) in the generalized additive models, and 1.066 (95% CI: 1.031, 1.102) in the threshold generalized additive models. The corresponding estimates for the case-crossover design were 1.039 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.066) in the conditional logistic regression, and 1.054 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.086) in the threshold conditional logistic regression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations, as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses, and suggests that effect estimates based on linear models (without thresholds) may underestimate the true risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart disease and stroke mortality and morbidity rates in Arkansas are among the highest in the U.S. While the effect of air pollution on cardiovascular health was identified in traffic-dominated metropolitan areas, there is a lack of studies for populations with variable exposure profiles, demographic and disease characteristics. OBJECTIVE: Determine the short-term effects of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity in the stroke and heart failure belt. METHODS: We investigated the associations of fine particles and ozone with respiratory and cardiovascular emergency room visits during the 2002-2012 period for adults in Central Arkansas using Poisson generalized models adjusted for temporal, seasonal and meteorological effects. We evaluated sensitivity of the associations to mutual pollutant adjustment and effect modification patterns by sex, age, race and season. RESULTS: We found effects on cardiovascular and respiratory emergencies for PM2.5 (1.52% [95% (confidence interval) CI: -1.10%, 4.20%]; 1.45% [95%CI: -2.64%, 5.72%] per 10 μg/m3) and O3 (0.93% [95%CI: -0.87%, 2.76%]; 0.76 [95%CI: -1.92%, 3.52%] per 10 ppbv) during the cold period (October-March). The effects were stronger among whites, except for the respiratory effects of O3 that were higher among Blacks/African-Americans. Effect modification patterns by age and sex differed by association. Both pollutants were associated with increases in emergency room visits for hypertension, heart failure and asthma. Effects on cardiovascular and respiratory emergencies were observed during the cold period when particulate matter was dominated by secondary nitrate and wood burning. CONCLUSION: Outdoor particulate pollution during winter had an effect on cardiovascular morbidity in central Arkansas, the region with high stroke and heart disease incidence rates.",

      "abstract": "Globally, exposure to air pollutants (black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)) is associated with respiratory diseases, however, research is limited in the Southern United States, particularly in Mississippi. This study investigated the influence of BC, PM2.5, and temperature on daily asthma and respiratory emergency department visits and hospital admissions among individuals ≥65 years old in the Jackson, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), over a two-year period. Time-series analysis explored the exposure-lag-response relationship between environmental factors and asthma and respiratory outcomes. During the study period, a total of 1466 asthma-related and 9482 respiratory disorder-related admissions were recorded with females representing 74 % of asthma-related and 59 % of respiratory disorder-related admissions. An interquartile range (IQR: 1.42 μg m-3) increase in BC concentration was associated with an increased risk of respiratory disorder-related admissions at lag 0, with a RR of 1.013 (95 % CI: 1.001-1.026) for all data, and an RR of 1.020 (95 % CI: 1.003-1.038) for the female subgroup. Neither BC nor PM2.5 was identified to be associated with asthma-related admissions. Springtime exposure to an IQR increase in BC (1.42 μg m-3) and PM2.5 (6.91 μg m-3) significantly increased the risk of asthma-related admissions at lag 1, with a RR of 1.490 (95 % CI: 1.207-1.840) and 1.471 (95 % CI: 1.010-2.143), respectively. Lower temperatures increased the risk of respiratory disorder-related admissions, with elevated RRs observed 10-25 days post-exposure. This study indicates that BC exposure, particularly among females, was more strongly associated with respiratory disorder-related admissions than PM2.5 exposure. Temperature variations exhibited a significant impact on respiratory disorder-related admissions compared to asthma-related admissions. BC revealed a significant antagonistic interaction with temperature, while PM2.5 showed no interaction. Identifying environmental factors affecting human health in disparity-prone areas like Mississippi is crucial to protect public health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The proportion of asthma patients with mild to moderate exacerbations is far greater than the number who experience episodes that are severe enough to require emergency room visits or hospital admission. However the routinely collected data from hospitals is absent in the past. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between short-term exposures to air pollutants and hospital outpatient visits for asthma in China. METHODS: We obtained data for 143,057 asthma outpatient visits from the largest hospitals in 17 Chinese cities, between Jan 01 2013 and Dec 31 2015. We used daily concentrations of air pollutants measured by the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, and fitted conditional logistic regression models to determine the associations. RESULTS: Particulate matter ≤10μm in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increased risks of hospital outpatient visits for asthma on the same day, while the effects were delayed for particulate matter ≤2.5μm in diameter (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). For the cumulative effect model at lag05 days, 10 μg/m3 increase in air pollutants concentrations were correlated with hospital outpatient visits for asthma with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 1.004 (1.000-1.008) for PM2.5, 1.005 (1.002-1.008) for PM10, 1.030 (1.021-1.040) for NO2, and 1.015 (1.008-1.021) for SO2. Almost one in nine (10.9%; 7.7, 13.9%) hospital outpatient visits for asthma were attributable to NO2. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 were associated with hospital outpatient visits for asthma in China.",

      "abstract": "Ambient air pollution exposure has been associated with several health conditions, limited not only to respiratory and cardiovascular systems but also to cutaneous tissues. However, few epidemiological studies examined pollution exposure on skin problems. Basically, the common mechanism by which pollution may affect skin physiology is by induction of oxidative stress and inflammation. Urticaria is among the skin pathologies that have been associated with pollution. Based on the combined effects of three ambient air pollutants, ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and fine particulate matter (PM) with a median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)), on mortality, the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) in Canada was developed. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of short-term changes in AQHI with emergency department (ED) visits for urticaria in Windsor-area hospitals in Canada. Diagnosed ED visits were retrieved from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS). A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to 2905 ED visits (males = 1215; females = 1690) for urticaria from April 2004 through December 2010. Odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for ED visits associated with increase by one unit of risk index were calculated employing conditional logistic regression. Positive and significant results were observed between AQHI levels and OR for ED visits for urticaria in Windsor for lags 2 and 3 days. A distributed lag nonlinear model technique was applied to daily counts of ED visits for lags 0 to 10 and significant results were obtained from lag 2 to lag 5 and for lag 9. These findings demonstrated associations between ambient air pollution and urticarial confirming that air pollution affects skin conditions.",

We evaluated the association between WFS and asthma healthcare utilization (AHCU) during the 2013 wildfire season in Oregon. WFS particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) was estimated using a blended model of in situ monitoring, chemical transport models, and satellite-based data.

Using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, pollutant concentrations were modeled using moving averages and distributed lag nonlinear models (lag 0-6) to examine lag associations and nonlinear concentration-response. The adjusted odds ratios for a 10 µg/m3 increase in 3-day moving average (lag 0-2) PM2.5 in the two-pollutant models among patients with and without allergic comorbidities were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.13) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.09), respectively; and for a 20 ppb increase in 3-day moving average (lag 0-2) ozone were 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.14) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.05), respectively.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to particulate material produced as a result of increased agricultural activity may increase the number of pneumonia hospitalizations among children. We hope to contribute to the knowledge base through highlighting the environmental mechanisms involved in this outcome and optimizing pollutant control policies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between pneumonia hospitalizations among children and presence of environmental pollutants in a town in the Brazilian Legal Amazon region. DESIGN AND SETTING: Time series study conducted in the town of Tangará da Serra, Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil. METHODS: A total of 158 children aged 0 to 10 years participated in the study. Data on environmental variables and pollutants were extracted daily through the Coupled Chemistry-Aerosol-Tracer Transport model coupled to Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (CCATT-BRAMS). Meteorological data were provided by the Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies Center (CPTEC). RESULTS: There was greater frequency of pneumonia hospitalizations in the months of transition between the rainy and dry seasons, with a prevalence ratio 2.4 times higher than in other periods. For environmental pollutants, there was a significant positive correlation between particulate matter (PM2.5) and pneumonia hospitalizations (correlation 0.11), with more admissions on the days when PM2.5 levels were highest (averages of 6.6 µg/m3 when there were no admissions and 13.11 µg/m3 on days with two or more admissions). CONCLUSIONS: The higher the PM2.5 level was, the greater the frequency of hospitalizations also was. Children living in peripheral areas had higher prevalence of pneumonia hospitalizations in the dry period than those who were living in the town center.",

Hospital admissions for respiratory diseases including pneumonia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ambient air pollution data for Kaohsiung were obtained for the period 2006-2010. The relative risk (RR) of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and chronic time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased number of admissions for respiratory diseases were significantly associated with higher PM2.5 levels only on cool days (<25°C), with an interquartile range rise associated with a 50 (95% CI% = 45-55%), 40% (95% CI = 25-58%), and 46% (95% CI = 36-57%) elevation in frequency of admissions for pneumonia, asthma, and COPD, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 levels remained significant even controlling for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, or ozone on cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 increase the risk of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Taiwan.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We used log-linear and log-log exposure-response (E-R) functions to model the association between PM2.5 exposure and non-elective hospitalizations for pneumonia, and estimated the attributable hospital costs by using the effect estimates obtained from both functions. METHODS: We used hospital discharge data on 3519 non-elective pneumonia admissions from UZ Brussels between 2007 and 2012 and we combined a case-crossover design with distributed lag models. The annual averted pneumonia hospitalization costs for a reduction in PM2.5 exposure from the mean (21.4μg/m(3)) to the WHO guideline for annual mean PM2.5 (10μg/m(3)) were estimated and extrapolated for Belgium. RESULTS: Non-elective hospitalizations for pneumonia were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure in both models. Using a log-linear E-R function, the estimated risk reduction for pneumonia hospitalization associated with a decrease in mean PM2.5 exposure to 10μg/m(3) was 4.9%. The corresponding estimate for the log-log model was 10.7%. These estimates translate to an annual pneumonia hospital cost saving in Belgium of €15.5 million and almost €34 million for the log-linear and log-log E-R function, respectively. DISCUSSION: Although further research is required to assess the shape of the association between PM2.5 exposure and pneumonia hospitalizations, we demonstrated that estimates for health effects and associated costs heavily depend on the assumed E-R function. These results are important for policy making, as supra-linear E-R associations imply that significant health benefits may still be obtained from additional pollution control measures in areas where PM levels have already been reduced.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Smoke plumes from the 2023 Canadian wildfires severely impacted air quality across the Eastern and Midwestern USA. However, a comprehensive health impact assessment is lacking in this large region. We investigated the association between wildfire-related air pollutants and the risk of mortality and hospitalization among hemodialysis patients in 22 heavily impacted states in the Eastern and Midwestern USA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis with a conditional quasi-Poisson model. The study included 52,995 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving hemodialysis at Fresenius Kidney Care clinics during June and July 2023. The presence of wildfire smoke and fine particulate matter (with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microns, PM2.5) concentrations were assessed using satellite-derived smoke polygons and ground-based monitors. Daily number of all-cause deaths, all-cause hospitalizations, respiratory disease hospitalizations, and cardiovascular disease hospitalizations were counted for each hemodialysis clinic. RESULTS: The highest daily wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration observed (251.1 μg/m3) far exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 μg/m3). The presence of wildfire smoke plume was associated with an 18% increase in risk of same day (lag0) all-cause mortality (rate ratio [RR]:1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.24) and a 3% increase in risk of all-cause hospitalization (RR:1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.07). A 10 μg/m3 increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 139% increase in same day all-cause mortality (RR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.79-3.18), and a 33% increase in all-cause hospitalization (RR:1.33; 95% CI: 1.10-1.62). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that air pollution from the 2023 Canadian wildfires resulted in increased risk of mortality and hospitalization among hemodialysis patients in Eastern and Midwestern USA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence on the association between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is limited in China. OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between PM2.5 and AECOPD in Yancheng, China from 2015 to 2017. METHODS: In this time-series study, we used a generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson regression to investigate the association between PM2.5 and AECOPD admitted in two major hospitals in Yancheng. We tested the robustness of the associations using two-pollutant models and examined the potential effect modification by age, gender and season via stratification analyses. Lastly, we fitted the concentration-response curves. RESULTS: We identified a total of 4761 AECOPD inpatients during the study period. The average daily-mean PM2.5 concentration was 45.2 μg/m3. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration on the concurrent day of the onset of AECOPD was associated with a 1.05% (95% confidence interval: 0.14%, 1.96%) increase in AECOPD. The association was robust to the adjustment of ozone, but not to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The association was larger in females, elderly patients, and was restricted within the cold season, but all between-group differences were insignificant. The concentration-response relationship curves were generally linear but flatted at concentrations over 40 μg/m3. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a higher risk of AECOPD associated with present-day PM2.5 exposure in a Chinese city. We further provided important information on lag patterns, susceptible subgroups, sensitive seasons, as well as the characteristics of the concentration-response relationship curves.",

This study aims to evaluate the correlation between air pollutants and hospitalization due to myocardial infarction (MI) as part of \"correlation of air pollution with hospitalization and mortality of CVDs and respiratory diseases (CAPACITY) study\". METHODS: This case-crossover study analyzed the data of 319 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) in three main hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. The data of airborne pollutants including particulate matter < 10 µm (PM10), particulate matter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) as well as climatic indices (temperature, wind speed, and humidity) at 24 hours, 48 hours, and one week before admission were extracted from CAPACITY study. The conditional logistic regression method was used to evaluate the correlation between air pollutants and MI hospitalization. RESULTS: 319 patients with mean age of 63.15 ± 28.14 years, including 238 men (74.6%), and 207 patients with STEMI (64.8%) were recruited. The risk of hospitalization significantly increased in patients with STEMI and 10-unit increment in PM2.5 at 48 hours before admission [odds ratio (OR) = 3.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-7.69]. Although, majority of air pollutants had positive association with hospitalization in patients with NSTEMI, they were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study showed significant association between elevated PM2.5 at 48 hours before admission and hospitalization of patients with STEMI. This finding can warn policymakers to design better care services for patients at risk of acute MI during the times of increased air pollution.",

      "title": "Air Pollution and Childhood Asthma Hospitalizations in Chengdu, China: A Time-Series Study.",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Research on the relationship between air pollutants and hospitalization for asthma in children in developing countries remains inadequate. This study aimed to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5), and particulate matter ≤ 10 µm (PM10), on children hospitalized for asthma in Chengdu, China, from 2017-2022. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the study period, 5592 children were hospitalized for asthma. A generalized additive model was used to control for seasonality, long-term trends, weather, day of the week, and holidays. The analysis was further stratified by age, sex, and season to estimate the associations. RESULTS: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO were significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization due to asthma. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, and CO at lag04 corresponded to an increase of 2.07%, 1.56%, and 0.33% in daily hospital admissions for asthma, respectively. A 10 μg/m3 increase in SO2 and NO2 at lag05 corresponded to an increase of 45.69% and 8.16% in daily hospital admissions for asthma, respectively. Further analysis by age found that PM10 and PM2.5 had a greater impact on children aged 5-6 years old while NO2 and CO mainly affected children under 7 years old. Analysis by by sex found that pollutants had a greater impact on hospital admissions in girls. Seasonal analysis revealed that pollutants had a more significant effect on admission during the winter. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO in Chengdu lead to hospitalization for asthma in children and that a lag effect was observed, especially with SO2. These findings highlight the need for stricter air quality controls to reduce childhood asthma hospitalizations. • Exposure to air pollutants increases the risk of hospitalization for children with asthma. • The effect of each studied air pollutant varies according to the age and sex of the child. • The effect of air pollutants on children with asthma was stronger in the winter. • Air quality control standards are needed to reduce hospitalizations for asthma in children.",

      "abstract": "The authors investigated whether short-term effects of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < or =2.5 microm (PM(2.5)) on risk of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations among the elderly varied by region and season in 202 US counties for 1999-2005. They fit 3 types of time-series models to provide evidence for 1) consistent particulate matter effects across the year, 2) different particulate matter effects by season, and 3) smoothly varying particulate matter effects throughout the year. The authors found statistically significant evidence of seasonal and regional variation in estimates of particulate matter effect. Respiratory disease effect estimates were highest in winter, with a 1.05% (95% posterior interval: 0.29, 1.82) increase in hospitalizations per 10-microg/m(3) increase in same-day PM(2.5). Cardiovascular diseases estimates were also highest in winter, with a 1.49% (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.89) increase in hospitalizations per 10-microg/m(3) increase in same-day PM(2.5), with associations also observed in other seasons. The strongest evidence of a relation between PM(2.5) and hospitalizations was in the Northeast for both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Heterogeneity of PM(2.5) effects on hospitalizations may reflect seasonal and regional differences in emissions and in particles' chemical constituents. Results can help guide development of hypotheses and further epidemiologic studies on potential heterogeneity in the toxicity of constituents of the particulate matter mixture.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to air pollution is an important cause of hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, few studies use pollutant concentration data estimated by mathematical models. A time-series ecological study was developed, using data from hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases in people over 60 years of age, residents of Cuiabá, Brazil, during 2012, obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The independent variables were the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) estimated by mathematical modeling, minimum temperature, and relative humidity (obtained from the Brazilian Meteorological Agency), and the number of forest fires. The generalized linear regression model of Poisson was used, with lags of 0 to 7 days. The coefficients obtained were transformed into relative risk of hospitalization, with respective 95% confidence intervals; alpha=5% was adopted. In that year, 591 hospitalizations were evaluated, with a daily average of 1.61 (SD=1.49), the PM2.5 average concentration was 15.7 µg/m3, and the CO average concentration was 144.2 ppb. Significant associations between exposure to these contaminants and hospitalizations in lags 3 and 4 in 2012 were observed. There was a hospitalization risk increase of 31.8%, with an increase of 3.5 µg/m3 of PM2.5 concentrations and an increase of 188 in the total number of hospitalizations, with an expense of more than ≈US$ 96,000 for the Brazilian Public Health System. This study provided information on the cost of air pollution to the health system and the feasibility of using a mathematical model to estimate environmental concentration of air pollutants.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity of children and adults in the city of Vitoria, state of Espirito Santo. METHODS: A study was carried out using time-series models via Poisson regression from hospitalization and pollutant data in Vitoria, ES, Southeastern Brazil, from 2001 to 2006. Fine particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) were tested as independent variables in simple and cumulative lags of up to five days. Temperature, humidity and variables indicating weekdays and city holidays were added as control variables in the models. RESULTS: For each increment of 10 µg/m3 of the pollutants PM10, SO2, and O3, the percentage of relative risk (%RR) for hospitalizations due to total respiratory diseases increased 9.67 (95%CI 11.84-7.54), 6.98 (95%CI 9.98-4.17) and 1.93 (95%CI 2.95-0.93), respectively. We found %RR = 6.60 (95%CI 9.53-3.75), %RR = 5.19 (95%CI 9.01-1.5), and %RR = 3.68 (95%CI 5.07-2.31) for respiratory diseases in children under the age of five years for PM10, SO2, and O3, respectively. Cardiovascular diseases showed a significant relationship with O3, with %RR = 2.11 (95%CI 3.18-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory diseases presented a stronger and more consistent relationship with the pollutants researched in Vitoria. A better dose-response relationship was observed when using cumulative lags in polynomial distributed lag models. OBJETIVO: Analisar o impacto da poluição atmosférica na morbidade respiratória e cardiovascular de crianças e adultos em Vitória. MÉTODOS: Foi realizado estudo utilizando modelos de séries temporais via regressão de Poisson a partir de dados de hospitalizações e poluentes em Vitória, ES, de 2001 a 2006. Foram testadas como variáveis independentes o material particulado fino (PM10); o dióxido de enxofre (SO2) e o ozônio (O3) em defasagem simples e acumulada até cinco dias. Introduziu-se temperatura, umidade e variáveis indicadoras dos dias da semana e feriados da cidade como variáveis de controle nos modelos. RESULTADOS: Para cada incremento de 10 µg/m3 dos poluentes PM10, SO2 e O3, foram observados aumentos no risco relativo percentual (RR%) para as hospitalizações por doenças respiratórias totais de 9,67 (IC95% 11,84-7,54), 6,98 (IC95% 9,98-4,17) e 1,93 (IC95% 2,95-0,93), respectivamente. Encontrou-se RR% = 6,60 (IC95% 9,53-3,75), RR% = 5,19 (IC95% 9,01-1,5) e RR% = 3,68 (IC95% 5,07-2,31) para doenças respiratórias em menores de cinco anos para o PM10, SO2 e O3, respectivamente. As doenças cardiovasculares apresentaram relação significativa com o O3 com RR% = 2,11 (IC95% 3,18-1,06). CONCLUSÕES: As doenças respiratórias apresentaram relação mais forte e consistente com os poluentes pesquisados em Vitória.

      "abstract": "We undertook this study to investigate whether there is an association between atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) levels and inpatient admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Taipei, Taiwan. Data on inpatient admissions for COPD and ambient on air pollution levels in Taipei were obtained for years 2006 to 2010. We estimated the relative risk of inpatient admissions for COPD using a case-crossover design with the following control variables: weather measures, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (not controlling for other atmospheric pollutants), COPD admissions were significantly and positively associated with higher PM2.5 levels during both warm days (>23 °C) and cool days (<23 °C), with an interquartile range increase of 12% (95% CI = 8-16%) and 3% (95% CI = 0-7%) in COPD admissions, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 remained significant even controlling for SO2 or O3 on both warm and cool days. Taken as a whole, our study demonstrates that higher levels of PM2.5 may increase the risk of inpatient admissions for COPD.",

      "title": "The correlation between respiratory infectious diseases, air pollution, and meteorological factors in Jinan, China from 2021 to 2023.",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological patterns of respiratory infectious diseases in Jinan from 2021 to 2023 and to elucidate the relationship among these diseases, meteorological factors, and air pollution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of outpatient and inpatient data related to respiratory infectious diseases recorded by the Jinan Health Care Development Center from 2021 to 2023. Additionally, we gathered data on outdoor air pollution indicators and meteorological variables from 14 environmental monitoring stations in Jinan. A generalized Poisson regression model for time series analysis was employed to examine the correlation between meteorological factors, air pollution levels, and hospitalization rates for respiratory infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2021 to 2023, the daily average concentrations of atmospheric pollutants sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) adhered to the national air quality standards, while the daily average concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (PM10) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exceeded the national first-class limits. The daily average concentration of ozone (O3) surpassed the national secondary standard, indicating severe O3 pollution. Regarding respiratory disease patients, the relative risk (RR) values of PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO were highest at a lag of 07 d. Compared to other age groups, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO had a more significant impact on respiratory disease treatment on children aged 0-12, while PM10 significantly affected individuals aged 60 and above. In the single pollution model, RR values corresponding to PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NO2 were 1.008, 1.058, 1.224, 1.405, and 1.102 respectively on lag07d. The multi-pollutant model maintained the positive relationship between the total hospitalization frequency of respiratory diseases and CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5. CONCLUSION: Our study found a strong, positive correlation with a lag effect between total number of hospitalizations for common respiratory diseases and pollutants CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 in the examined sample.",

      "title": "Impacts of Regulations on Air Quality and Emergency Department Visits in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, 1999-2013.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The United States and Western Europe have seen great improvements in air quality, presumably in response to various regulations curtailing emissions from the broad range of sources that have contributed to local, regional, and global pollution. Such regulations, and the ensuing controls, however, have not come without costs, which are estimated at tens of billions of dollars per year. These costs motivate accountability-related questions such as, to what extent do regulations lead to emissions changes? More important, to what degree have the regulations provided the expected human health benefits? UNLABELLED: Here, the impacts of specific regulations on both electricity generating unit (EGU) and on-road mobile sources are examined through the classical accountability process laid out in the 2003 Health Effects Institute report linking regulations to emissions to air quality to health effects, with a focus on the 1999-2013 period. This analysis centers on regulatory actions in the southeastern United States and their effects on health outcomes in the 5-county Atlanta metropolitan area. The regulations examined are largely driven by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (C). This work investigates regulatory actions and controls promulgated on EGUs: the Acid Rain Program (ARP), the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP), and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) - and mobile sources: Tier 2 Gasoline Vehicle Standards and the 2007 Heavy Duty Diesel Rule. METHODS: Each step in the classic accountability process was addressed using one or more methods. Linking regulations to emissions was accomplished by identifying major federal regulations and the associated state regulations, along with analysis of individual facility emissions and control technologies and emissions modeling (e.g., using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [U.S. EPA's] MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator [MOVES] mobile-source model). Regulators, including those from state environmental and transportation agencies, along with the public service commissions, play an important role in implementing federal rules and were involved along with other regional stakeholders in the study. We used trend analysis, air quality modeling, satellite data, and a ratio-of-ratios technique to investigate a critical current issue, a potential large bias in mobile-source oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions estimates. UNLABELLED: The second link, emissions-air quality relationships, was addressed using both empirical analyses as well as chemical transport modeling employing the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filtering accounting for day of the year was used to separate the air quality signal into long-term, seasonal, weekday-holiday, and short-term meteorological signals. Regression modeling was then used to link emissions and meteorology to ambient concentrations for each of the species examined (ozone [O3], particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], sulfate [SO4-2], nitrate [NO3-], ammonium [NH4+], organic carbon [OC], and elemental carbon [EC]). CMAQ modeling was likewise used to link emissions changes to air quality changes, as well as to further establish the relative roles of meteorology versus emissions change impacts on air quality trends. CMAQ and empirical modeling were used to investigate aerosol acidity trends, employing the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic equilibrium model to calculate pH based on aerosol composition. The relationships between emissions and meteorology were then used to construct estimated counterfactual air quality time series of daily pollutant concentrations that would have occurred in the absence of the regulations. Uncertainties in counterfactual air quality were captured by the construction of 5,000 pollutant time series using a Monte Carlo sampling technique, accounting for uncertainties in emissions and model parameters. UNLABELLED: Health impacts of the regulatory actions were assessed using data on cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits, using patient-level data in the Atlanta area for the 1999-2013 period. Four outcome groups were chosen based on previous studies identifying associations with ambient air pollution: a combined respiratory disease (RD) category; the subgroup of RD presenting with asthma; a combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) category; and the subgroup of CVD presenting with congestive heart failure (CHF). UNLABELLED: Models were fit to estimate the joint effects of multiple pollutants on ED visits in a time-series framework, using Poisson generalized linear models accounting for overdispersion, with a priori model formulations for temporal and meteorological covariates and lag structures. Several parameterizations were considered for the joint-effects models, including different sets of pollutants and models with nonlinear pollutant terms and first-order interactions among pollutants. Use of different periods for parameter estimates was assessed, as associations between pollutant levels and ED visits varied over the study period. A 7-pollutant, nonlinear model with pollutant interaction terms was chosen as the baseline model and fitted using pollutant and outcome data from 1999-2005 before regulations might have substantially changed the toxicity of pollutant mixtures. In separate analyses, these models were fitted using pollutant and outcome data from the entire 1999-2013 study period. Daily counterfactual time series of pollutant concentrations were then input into the health models, and the differences between the observed and counterfactual concentrations were used to estimate the impacts of the regulations on daily counts of ED visits. To account for the uncertainty in both the estimation of the counterfactual time series of ambient pollutant levels and the estimation of the health model parameters, we simulated 5,000 sets of parameter estimates using a multivariate normal distribution based on the observed variance-covariance matrix, allowing for uncertainty at each step of the chain of accountability. Sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: EGU NOx and SO2 emissions in the Southeast decreased by 82% and 83%, respectively, between 1999 and 2013, while mobile-source emissions controls led to estimated decreases in Atlanta-area pollutant emissions of between 61% and 93%, depending on pollutant. While EGU emissions were measured, mobile-source emissions were modeled. Our results are supportive of a potential high bias in mobile-source NOx and CO emissions estimates. Air quality benefits from regulatory actions have increased as programs have been fully implemented and have had varying impacts over different seasons. In a scenario that accounted for all emissions reductions across the period, observed Atlanta central monitoring site maximum daily 8-hour (MDA8h) O3 was estimated to have been reduced by controls in the summertime and increased in the wintertime, with a change in mean annual MDA8h O3 from 39.7 ppb (counterfactual) to 38.4 ppb (observed). PM2.5 reductions were observed year-round, with average 2013 values at 8.9 μg/m3 (observed) versus 19.1 μg/m3 (counterfactual). Empirical and CMAQ analyses found that long-term meteorological trends across the Southeast over the period examined played little role in the distribution of species concentrations, while emissions changes explained the decreases observed. Aerosol pH, which plays a key role in aerosol formation and dynamics and may have health implications, was typically very low (on the order of 1-2, but sometimes much lower), with little trend over time despite the stringent SO2 controls and SO42- reductions. UNLABELLED: Using health models fit from 1999-2005, emissions reductions from all selected pollution-control policies led to an estimated 55,794 cardiorespiratory disease ED visits prevented (i.e., fewer observed ED visits than would have been expected under counterfactual scenarios) - 52,717 RD visits, of which 38,038 were for asthma, and 3,057 CVD visits, of which 2,104 were for CHF - among the residents of the 5-county area over the 1999-2013 period, an area with approximately 3.5 million people in 2013. During the final two years of the study (2012-2013), when pollution-control policies were most fully implemented and the associated benefits realized, these policies were estimated to prevent 5.9% of the RD ED visits that would have occurred in the absence of the policies (95% interval estimate: -0.4% to 12.3%); 16.5% of the asthma ED visits (95% interval estimate: 7.5% to 25.1%); 2.3% of the CVD ED visits (95% interval estimate: -1.8% to 6.2%); and -.6% of the CHF ED visits (95% interval estimate: 26.3% to 10.4%). Estimates of ED visits prevented were generally lower when using health models fit for the entire 1999-2013 study period. UNLABELLED: Sensitivity analyses were conducted to show the impact of the choice of parameterization of the health models and to assess alternative definitions of the study area. When impacts were assessed for separate policy interventions, policies affecting emissions from EGUs, especially the ARP and the NBP, appeared to have had the greatest effect on prevention of RD and asthma ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of regulations on improving air quality and health in the southeastern United States. It also demonstrates the complexities of accountability assessments as uncertainties are introduced in each step of the classic accountability process. While accounting for uncertainties in emissions, air quality-emissions relationships, and health models does lead to relatively large uncertainties in the estimated outcomes due to specific regulations, overall the benefits of regulations have been substantial.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown the worst effects of air pollution on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Present study focused on the relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF), as one of the common arrhythmias, and air pollutants in Isfahan, Iran, an industrial city in the Middle East. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to explore the associations between air pollution and AF hospitalized patients with ventricular response (VR) > 90 beats per minute (bpm) (fast response) and those with VR ≤ 90 bpm. All patients' records were extracted from their hospital files. Air pollutants data including particulate matter less than 10 µ (PM10), PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) were obtained from the Correlation of Air Pollution with Hospitalization and Mortality of Cardiovascular and Respiratory Diseases (CAPACITY) study. Conditional logistic regression test was used to measure the relationship between pollutants and hospitalization due to AF. RESULTS: Records of 369 patients, including 173 men (46.9%) who were hospitalized for AF during the study period and had complete data were extracted. Although a positive but not statistically significant relationship was shown between 10-unit increases in all pollutants (except PM10) and the hospitalization due to AF in patients with rapid VR (RVR), the only significant relationship was observed in case of NO2 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-2.1, P = 0.031]. CONCLUSION: This study showed positive significant relationships between NO2 and the hospitalization due to AF in patients with RVR. NO2 is a greenhouse gas whose levels are expected to increase due to global environmental changes. Therefore, relevant strategies should be adopted to decrease its levels, especially in industrial cities like Isfahan.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Evidence between air pollution and COPD admissions is inconsistent and limited in China. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of air pollutants on COPD admissions in Beijing, China. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Daily COPD hospital admission visits derived from tertiary and secondary hospitals in Beijing were retrieved from January 2013 to February 2017. Air pollutant levels and meteorological data over the same periods were also achieved. Generalized additive model was applied to estimate the percentage changes with 95% CIs in daily admissions corresponding to 10 µg/m3 increases in pollutants levels [1 mg/m3 in carbon monoxide (CO)], stratified by age, gender, and season. RESULTS: Seventy-three thousand seventy-six COPD hospital admission visits were included with mean daily visits of 48 (21). Cumulative lag effect with per 10 µg/m3 increase in air pollutant levels was largest for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with 3.03% (95% CI: 1.82%-4.26%) at lag 06, for sulfur dioxide (SO2) with 2.07% (95% CI: 1.00%-3.15%) at lag 01, for particulate matter ≤10 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) with 0.92% (95% CI: 0.55%-1.30%) at lag 07, and for particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) with 0.82% (95% CI: 0.38%-1.26%) at lag 06, respectively. Percentage increase for each 1 mg/m3 increase in CO was 5.99% (95% CI: 2.74%-9.34%) at lag 06. Further, stronger effects on COPD admissions were found in warm seasons than in cold seasons. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO had adverse effects on COPD hospitalizations in Beijing with different magnitudes and lag days.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological analyses of air quality often estimate human exposure from ambient monitoring data, potentially leading to exposure misclassification and subsequent bias in estimated health risks. To investigate this, we conducted a case-crossover study of summertime ambient ozone and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) levels and daily respiratory hospitalizations in New York City during 2001-2005. Comparisons were made between associations estimated using two pollutant exposure metrics: observed concentrations and predicted exposures from the EPA's Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) model. Small, positive associations between interquartile range mean ozone concentrations and hospitalizations were observed and were strongest for 0-day lags (hazard ratio (HR)=1.013, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.998, 1.029) and 3-day lags (HR=1.006, 95% CI: 0.991, 1.021); applying mean predicted ozone exposures yielded similar results. PM(2.5) was also associated with admissions, strongest at 2- and 4-day lags, with few differences between exposure metrics. Subgroup analyses support recognized sociodemographic differences in concentration-related hospitalization risk, whereas few inter-stratum variations were observed in relation to SHEDS exposures. Predicted exposures for these spatially homogenous pollutants were similar across sociodemographic strata, therefore SHEDS predictions coupled with the case-crossover design may have masked observable heterogeneity in risks. However, significant effect modification was found for subjects in the top exposure-to-concentration ratio tertiles, suggesting risks may increase as a consequence of infiltration or greater exposure to outdoor air.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health studies of air pollution are increasingly aiming to study associations between air pollutant mixtures and health. OBJECTIVE: Estimate associations between observed combinations of ambient air pollutants and select cardiorespiratory outcomes in Columbia, SC during 2002 to 2013. METHODS: We estimate associations using a two-stage approach. First, we identified a collection of observed pollutant combinations, which we define as multipollutant day types (MDTs), by applying a self-organizing map (SOM) to daily measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter ≤ 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Then, overdispersed Poisson time-series models were used to estimate associations between MDTs and each outcome using a 'clean' MDT referent and controlling for long-term, seasonal, and day-of-the-week trends and meteorology. Outcomes included daily emergency department visits for asthma and upper respiratory infection (URI), and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure (CHF) and ischemic heart disease (IHD). RESULTS: We found that a number of MDTs were significantly and positively associated (point estimates ranged from~2-5%) with cardiorespiratory outcomes in Columbia when compared to days with low pollution. Estimated associations revealed that outcomes for asthma, URIs, and IHD increased 2-4% on warm, dry days experiencing elevated levels of O3 and PM2.5. We also found that cooler days with higher NO2 pollution associated with increased asthma, CHF, and IHD outcomes (2-5%). CONCLUSION: Our analysis continues support for using self-organizing maps to develop multipollutant exposure metrics and further illustrates how such metrics can be applied to explore associations between pertinent pollutant combinations and health.",

Pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility of pooling state hospitalization data and linking these data to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) statistically based ambient air estimates for ozone and fine particulates. Tools were developed to perform case-crossover analyses to estimate concentration-response (C-R) functions. A weakness of analyzing one state at a time is that the effects are relatively small compared to their confidence intervals. The EPHT program will explore ways to statistically combine the results of peer-reviewed analyses from across the country to provide more robust C-R functions and health impact estimates at the local level. One challenge will be to routinely share data for these types of analyses at fine geographic and temporal scales without disclosing confidential information. Another challenge will be to develop C-R estimates which take into account time, space, or other relevant effect modifiers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) emitted from biomass burning is an increasing concern, particularly in Southeast Asia. It is not yet clear how the source of PM influences the risk of an adverse health outcome. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare health risks of PM from biomass burning and non-biomass burning sources in northern Thailand. METHODS: We collected ambient air pollutant data (PM with a diameter of < 10 μm [PM10], PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide [CO], Ozone [O3], and Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]) from ground-based monitors and daily outpatient hospital visits in Thailand during 2014-2017. Outpatient data included chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). We performed an ecological time series analysis to evaluate the association between daily air pollutants and outpatient visits. We used the 90th and 95th percentiles of PM10 concentrations to determine days of exposure to PM predominantly from biomass burning. RESULTS: There was significant intra annual variation in PM10 levels, with the highest concentrations occurring during March, coinciding with peak biomass burning. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) between daily PM10 and outpatient visits were elevated most on the same day as exposure for CLRD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.012 to 1.028) and CBVD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.004 to 1.035), with no association with IHD = 0.994 (95% CI: 0.974 to 1.014). Adjusting for CO tended to increase effect estimates. We did not find evidence of an exposure response relationship with levels of PM10 on days of biomass burning. CONCLUSIONS: We found same-day exposures of PM10 to be associated with certain respiratory and cardiovascular outpatient visits. We advise implementing measures to reduce population exposures to PM wherever possible, and to improve understanding of health effects associated with burning specific types of biomass in areas where such large-scale activities occur.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The associations between viral etiology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) with meteorological factors and air pollutants among children is not fully understood. This study aimed to explore the viral etiology among children hospitalized for ARI and the association of meteorological factors and air pollutants with children hospitalization due to viral ARI. METHODS: Electronic health record data about children (aged between 1 month and 14 years) admitted for ARI at Kiang Wu Hospital in Macao between 2014 and 2017 was analyzed retrospectively. xMAP multiplex assays were used to detect viruses in the nasopharyngeal swab and distributed-lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to evaluate associations. RESULTS: Among the 4880 cases of children hospitalization due to ARI, 3767 (77.2%) were tested positive for at least one virus and 676 (18%) exhibited multiple infections. Enterovirus (EV)/rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (IFV) were the most common viral pathogens associated with ARI and human bocavirus (hBOV) exhibited the highest multiple infection rates. Meteorological factors and air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) were associated with the risk of viral ARI hospitalization. The relative risk of viral infection increased with daily mean temperature but plateaued when temperature exceeded 23 °C, and increased when the relative humidity was < 70% and peaked at 50%. The effect of solar radiation was insignificant. Air pollutants (including PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3) showed strong and immediate effect on the incidence of viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of mean temperature, relative humidity and air pollutants should be taken into account when considering management of ARI among children.",

      "abstract": "Air pollutants are known to trigger asthma and wheezing-associated lower respiratory infections in children, but evidence regarding their effect on hospital admissions in India is limited. We conducted a time-series study over a period of five years to assess the role of ambient air pollutants in daily asthma-related hospital admissions in children in Mysore, India. Daily asthma and wheeze (associated with lower respiratory infections) admissions were modelled using a generalised additive model (GAM) to examine the non-linear effects and generalised linear models (GLM) for linear effects, if any. Models were adjusted by day of the week and lag days, with smooth terms for time, maximum temperature, and relative humidity, and they were stratified by sex and age group. Of the 362 children admitted, more than 50% were boys, and the mean age was 5.34 years (±4.66). The GAMs showed non-linear associations between NO2, PM2.5, and NH3. For example, a 10 µgm-3 (or 10%) increase in NO2 increased admissions by 2.42. These non-linear effects were more pronounced in boys. A linear effect was detected for PM10 with a relative risk (95% CI) of 1.028, 1.013, and 1.043 with admission. Further research is needed to explore whether these findings can be replicated in different cities in India. Air pollution needs to be controlled, and policies that focus on lower cut-off levels for vulnerable populations are necessary.",

      "abstract": "Acute exacerbation of chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (AECOPD) as a respiratory disease, is considered to be related to air pollution by more and more studies. However, the evidence on how air pollution affect the incidence of AECOPD and whether there are population differences is still insufficient. Therefore, we select PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 as representatives combined with daily AECOPD admission data from 1 January 2015 to 26 June 2016 in the rural areas of Qingyang, northwestern China to explore the associations of air pollution with AECOPD. Based on a time-stratified case-crossover design, we constructed a distributed lag nonlinear model to qualify the single and cumulative lagged effects of air pollution on AECOPD. Stratified related risks by sex and age were also reported. The cumulative exposure-response curves were approximately linear for PM2.5, \"V\"-shaped for PM10, \"U\"-shaped for NO2 and inverted-\"V\" for SO2, CO and O3. Exposure to high-PM2.5 (42 μg/m3), high-PM10 (91 μg/m3), high-SO2 (58 μg/m3), low-NO2 (12 μg/m3), and high-CO (1.55 mg/m3) increased the risk of AECOPD. Females aged 15-64 were more susceptible under extreme concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, CO, and low-PM10 than other subgroups. In addition, adults aged 15-64 were more sensitive to extreme concentrations of NO2 compared with the elderly ≥65 years old, while the latter were more sensitive to high-PM10. High-SO2, high-NO2, and extreme concentrations of PM2.5 had the greatest effects on the day of exposure, while low-SO2 and low-CO had lagged effects on AECOPD. Precautionary measures should be taken with a focus on vulnerable subgroups, to control hospitalization for AECOPD associated with air pollutants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ozone (O3) has been associated with cardiorespiratory mortality although few studies have explored susceptible populations based on prior disease. We aimed to investigate the role of previous hospitalization on the association between short-term exposure to O3 and cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory mortality. METHODS: We performed time series analyses using generalized additive models and case-crossover on 136,624 CV and 23,281 respiratory deaths in Stockholm County (1990-2010). Deaths were linked to hospital admissions data. We constructed 2-day and 7-day averages using daily 8-h maximum for O3 and hourly values for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx from a fixed monitor. RESULTS: We observed a 0.7% (95% CI: 0.1%, 1.3%) and 2.7% (95% CI: 0.8%, 4.6%) higher risk of CV and respiratory death per 10 μg/m3 higher 2-day and 7-day average O3 respectively. Individuals previously hospitalized for myocardial infarction demonstrated 1.8% (95% CI: 0.4%, 3.4%) higher risk of CV death per 10 μg/m3 higher 2-day average O3 and similar associations were observed in individuals with no previous hospitalization for any cause. Individuals with previous hospitalizations did not show susceptibility towards O3-related risk of respiratory mortality. We observed no associations for other pollutants. CONCLUSION: Short-term ozone exposure is associated with CV and respiratory mortality and our results may suggest higher susceptibility to CV mortality following O3 exposure in individuals previously hospitalized for myocardial infarction. Higher risks were also observed in individuals with cardiovascular death as their first presentation of disease.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The effects of air pollution on human health have long been a hot topic of research. For respiratory diseases, a large number of studies have proved that air pollution is one of the main causes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of hospitalization of children with respiratory system diseases (CRSD) caused by six pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) in Hefei City, and further calculate the disease burden. METHOD: In the first stage, the generalized additive models were combined with the distributed lag non-linear models to evaluate the impact of air pollution on the inpatients for CRSD in Hefei. In the second stage, this study used the cost-of-illness approach to calculate the attributable number of hospitalizations and the extra disease burden. RESULT: Overall, all the six kinds of pollutants had the strongest effects on CRSD inpatients within lag10 days. SO2 and CO caused the highest and lowest harm, respectively, and the RR values were SO2 (lag0-5): 1.1 20 (1.053, 1.191), and CO (lag0-6): 1.002 (1.001, 1.003). During the study period (January 1, 2014 to December 30, 2020), the 7-year cumulative burden of disease was 36.19 million CNY under the WHO air pollution standards. CONCLUSION: In general, we found that six air pollutants were risk factors for CRSD in Hefei City, and create a huge burden of disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a major contributor to hospital admission for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, evidence for acute effects of ambient air pollution exposure on pneumonia hospital admission among patients with COPD is scarce. We aimed to examine the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and pneumonia hospital admission among patients with COPD. METHODS: We enrolled COPD cases aged ≥ 60 years old and further filtered those who were admitted into hospitals from pneumonia during 2016-2019 in Guangdong province, China for main analysis. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to investigate the association and conditional logistic regression model was used for data analysis. We performed inverse distance weighting method to estimate daily individual-level exposure on particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) based on personal residential addresses. RESULTS: We included 6473 pneumonia hospital admissions during the study period. Each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (lag 2; IQR, 22.1 μg/m3), SO2 (lag 03; IQR, 4.2 μg/m3), NO2 (lag 03; IQR, 21.4 μg/m3), and O3 (lag 04; IQR, 57.9 μg/m3) was associated with an odds ratio in pneumonia hospital admission of 1.043 (95% CI: 1.004-1.083), 1.081 (95% CI: 1.026-1.140), 1.045 (95% CI: 1.005-1.088), and 1.080 (95% CI: 1.018-1.147), respectively. Non-linear trends for PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 were observed in the study. Sex, age at hospital admission, and season at hospital admission did not modify the associations. CONCLUSIONS: We found significantly positive associations of short-term exposure to PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and O3 with pneumonia hospital admission among COPD patients. It provides new insight for comprehensive pneumonia prevention and treatment among COPD patients.",

This study used big data analysis to explore the effects of daily changes in air pollution and season on childhood asthma hospitalization from 2001 to 2010 in Taipei and Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A time-stratified case-crossover study and conditional logistic regression analysis were employed to identify associations between the risk of hospitalization due to asthma in children and the levels of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, SO₂, and NO₂) in the days preceding hospitalization. During the study period, 2900 children in Taipei and 1337 in Kaohsiung aged ≤15 years were hospitalized due to asthma for the first time. The results indicated that the levels of air pollutants were significantly associated with the risk of asthma hospitalization in children, and seasonal effects were observed. High levels of air pollution in Kaohsiung had greater effects than in Taipei after adjusting for seasonal variation. The most important factor was O₃ in spring in Taipei. In children aged 0-6 years, asthma was associated with O₃ in Taipei and SO₂ in Kaohsiung, after controlling for the daily mean temperature and relative humidity.",

Poisson generalized models were used to estimate the associations between air pollution and hospital visits for acute upper and lower respiratory infections adjusted for temporal, seasonal, and meteorological effects. We found that four pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2) were significantly associated with hospital visits for acute upper and lower respiratory infections. The effect estimates for acute upper respiratory infections tended to be higher (PM2.5 ER = 3.46, 95% CI 2.18, 4.76; PM10 ER = 2.81, 95% CI 1.93, 3.69; NO2 ER = 11.27, 95% CI 8.70, 13.89; SO2 ER = 15.17, 95% CI 11.29, 19.19). Significant associations for gaseous pollutants (NO2 and SO2) were observed after adjustment for particular matter. Stronger associations were observed among older children and in the cold period. Our study suggested that short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution was associated with hospital visits for acute upper and lower respiratory infections in Ningbo.",

      "abstract": "It is unclear whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and greenness have additional modifying effects on the association between air pollution and respiratory system disease. Utilizing a time-stratified case-crossover design with a distributed lag linear model, we analyzed the association between six pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) and 555,498 respiratory hospital admissions in Beijing from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2019. We employed conditional logistic regression, adjusting for meteorological conditions, holidays and influenza, to calculate percent change of hospitalization risk. Subsequently, we performed subgroup analysis to investigate potential effect modifications using a two-sample z test. Every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 led to increases of 0.26% (95%CI: 0.17%, 0.35%), 0.15% (95%CI: 0.09%, 0.22%), 0.61% (95%CI: 0.44%, 0.77%), 1.72% (95%CI: 1.24%, 2.21%), and 0.32% (95%CI: 0.20%, 0.43%) in admissions, respectively. Also, a 1 mg/m3 increase in CO levels resulted in a 2.50% (95%CI: 1.96%, 3.04%) rise in admissions. The links with NO2 (p < 0.001), SO2 (p < 0.001), O3 (during the warm season, p < 0.001), and CO (p < 0.001) were significantly weaker among patients residing in areas with higher levels of greenness. No significant modifying role of GDP was observed. Greenness can help mitigate the effects of air pollutants, while the role of GDP needs further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Evidence on the short-term effects of size-specific particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), ≤10 μm (PM10), and their difference (PMC) on children's Lower Respiratory Infections (LRI) is scare. This study aimed to estimate the differential effects of three size-specific PM on hospitalizations of children aged <18 years for pneumonia and bronchitis in 18 cities of southwestern China. The city-specific association was firstly estimated using the over-dispersed generalized additive model and then combined to obtain the regional average association. Further, to evaluate the robustness of the key findings, subgroup analyses and co-pollutant models were constructed. PM-related risks of LRI differed by PM fractions and cause-specific LRI. A 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5_lag03, PM10_lag06, and PMC_lag06 was associated with a 0.79% (95% CI: 0.29%, 1.29%), 0.77% (95% CI: 0.13%, 1.41%), and 2.33% (95% CI: 1.23%, 3.44%) increase in children's LRI hospitalizations, respectively. After adjustment for gaseous pollutants, adverse effects of the three types of size-specific PM on pneumonia hospitalizations were stable, ranging from 0.29% (95% CI: 0.05%, 0.54%) for PM2.5-2.50% (95% CI: 1.38%, 3.64%) for PMC. Additionally, PMC-related risk of bronchitis hospitalizations remained stable after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations of pneumonia with PMC and PM10 in infants, bronchitis with PM2.5 in children aged 6-17 years, pneumonia and bronchitis with PM2.5, PMC, and PM10 in children aged 1-5 years were all statistical significant. Specifically, the effects of PM2.5 on LRI hospitalizations increased by age, with the highest effect of 1.72% (95%CI: 1.01%, 2.43%) in children aged 6-17 years. Our study provided evidence for short-term effects of different PM fractions on children LRI hospitalizations in Southwestern China, which will be useful for making and promoting policies on air quality standards in order to protect children's health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may be worse at higher temperatures. OBJECTIVE: To investigate temperature's effect on PM2.5-mortality/morbidity associations in Lima, Peru. METHODS: Time-series regressions relating PM2.5 and temperature to mortality and emergency room (ER) visits during 2010-2016. Daily PM2.5 levels (assigned to 40 Lima districts) and daily maximum temperature (Lima-wide) were estimated based on ground monitors, remote sensing, and modeling. We analyzed all-cause, cardiovascular (ICD codes I00-I99), and respiratory (ICD codes J00-J99) mortality, and cardiovascular and respiratory causes for ER visits. RESULTS: The average PM2.5 concentration was 20.9 µg/m3 (IQR 17.5-23.5). The mean daily maximum temperature was 23.8 °C (IQR 20.8-26.9). PM2.5's effect on all-cause, respiratory, and circulatory disease mortality was significantly (p < 0.05) stronger at temperatures above the maximum temperature median. The rate ratios per increase of 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5 for all cause, respiratory, and circulatory mortality respectively were 1.03 (1.00-1.06), 1.04 (0.98-1.10), and 1.04 (0.98-1.10) at temperatures below the median, vs. 1.08 (1.04-1.12), 1.11 (1.03-1.19), and 1.14 (1.05-1.25) when temperatures were above the median. Results were analogous for ER visits for respiratory but not circulatory disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Results strengthen the evidence that air pollution may be more dangerous when temperatures are higher. IMPACT: Our data contribute to a growing body of literature which indicates that the damaging effects of PM2.5 may be worse at higher temperature, adding new evidence from Lima, Peru.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is one of the principal reasons for incidence and death in the world. The former research mainly concentrated on specific sources of patients. Besides, due to the heterogeneity among regions, there are inconsistencies in the outcome of these surveys. To explore the relationship between atmospheric pollution and hospital visits for pneumonia under the climate and pollution conditions in Qingdao, we carried out this study. METHODS: The medical records of pneumonia patients were gathered from the affiliated hospital of Qingdao University during Jan 1st, 2014, and Dec 31st,2018. Daily concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, as well as CO, were collected from the national air quality monitoring stations in Qingdao. Case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression model were used to estimate the associations. Daily temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure were adjusted as the covariates in all models. A principal component analysis was used to solve the multicollinearity between atmospheric pollutants and investigate the relationship between various air pollutants and pneumonia occurs. RESULTS: In the single pollutant model, with interquartile range increment of the density of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 at the lag2 days, the odds ratio of hospital visits for pneumonia patients increased by 6.4% (95%CI, 2.3-10.7%), 7.7% (95%CI, 3.2-12.4%), 6.7% (95%CI, 1.0-12.7%), and 7.2% (95%CI, 1.1-13.5%). Stratified analysis showed that pollutants were more significant in the cold period. Besides, the impact of atmospheric particulates on different ages mainly occurs in the young child (0 to 3-year-old). The odds ratio was 1.042 (95%CI, 1.012-1.072) when the principal components of atmospheric pollutants were included in the conditional logistic model. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a significant relationship between short-term uncovering to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and hospital visits for pneumonia in Qingdao. The effect of atmospheric pollutants mainly arose in a cold period. The particulate matter might be the principal reason in inducing hospital visits for pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "We estimated cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality associated with wildfire smoke (WFS) fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the Front Range of Colorado from 2010 to 2015. To estimate WFS PM2.5, we developed a daily kriged PM2.5 surface at a 15  × 15 km resolution based on the Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System monitors for the western United States; we subtracted out local seasonal-average PM2.5 of nonsmoky days, identified using satellite-based smoke plume estimates, from the local daily estimated PM2.5 if smoke was identified by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System. We implemented time-stratified case-crossover analyses to estimate the effect of a 10 µg/m3 increase in WFS PM2.5 with cardiopulmonary hospitalizations and deaths using single and distributed lag models for lags 0-5 and distinct annual impacts based on local and long-range smoke during 2012, and long-range transport of smoke in 2015. A 10 µg/m3 increase in WFS was associated with all respiratory, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations for lag day 3 and hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease at lag days 2 and 3. Cardiac arrest deaths were associated with WFS PM2.5 at lag day 0. For 2012 local wildfires, asthma hospitalizations had an inverse association with WFS PM2.5 (OR: 0.716, 95% CI: 0.517-0.993), but a positive association with WFS PM2.5 during the 2015 long-range transport event (OR: 1.455, 95% CI: 1.093-1.939). Cardiovascular mortality was associated with the 2012 long-range transport event (OR: 1.478, 95% CI: 1.124-1.944).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To analyze the impact of two interventions (implementation and suspension of mandatory vehicle inspection) on morbidity and mortality due to conditions related to air pollution, from 2008 to 2017. METHODS Interrupted time series (ARIMA models), using data available in public repositories. RESULTS A total of 229,337 children of up to 5 years old were hospitalized due to respiratory diseases, and 1,053 died (average monthly mortality ratio for this population: 1.12/100,000). Exact 137,876 individuals over 40 years old were hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction, and 19,492 died (3.7/100,000). A total of 11,010 individuals over 40 years old were hospitalized with malignant neoplasms of the respiratory system; 2,898 died (0.5/100,000). A total of 20,807 individuals over 60 years old were hospitalized with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; 2,627 died (1.5/100,000). As for strokes, 69,180 individuals were hospitalized, and 10,866 died (2.1/100,000). We found no significant regression coefficient for the implementation or suspension of the program regarding hospitalizations and deaths. 38,207 children of up to 14 years old were hospitalized with asthma, and 25 of them died (0.007/100,000). The coefficients show a monthly increase of 0.05 deaths/100,000 people (p = 0.01) in the post-inspection period. We found no correlation between the measured concentrations of the pollutants PM2.5 and CO - in a monitoring station, in the central region of the municipality - and the implementation or suspension of the inspection. CONCLUSIONS No evidence confirms that the program had a measurable beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality due to respiratory and circulatory diseases. OBJETIVO: Analisar o impacto de duas intervenções (introdução e suspensão da inspeção veicular obrigatória) sobre a morbidade e mortalidade por condições associadas à poluição do ar no período de 2008 a 2017. MÉTODOS: Séries temporais interrompidas (método Arima), com dados disponíveis em repositórios públicos. RESULTADOS: Houve 229.337 internações por doenças respiratórias em crianças até 5 anos de idade, com 1.053 óbitos (coeficiente médio de mortalidade mensal para a população da idade: 1,12/100.000). Para infarto agudo do miocárdio em maiores de 40 anos, houve 137.876 internações, com 19.492 óbitos (3,7/100.000). Para as neoplasias malignas do aparelho respiratório em maiores de 40 anos, foram 11.010 internações, com 2.898 óbitos (0,5/100.000). Para doenças pulmonares obstrutivas crônicas em maiores de 60 anos, foram 20.807 internações, com 2.627 óbitos (1,5/100.000). Para os acidentes vasculares cerebrais, foram 69.180 internações e 10.866 óbitos (2,1/100.000). Não houve nenhum coeficiente de regressão significativo para a introdução ou suspensão do programa em relação às internações e óbitos. Para asma em crianças até 14 anos, houve 38.207 internações e 25 óbitos (0,007/100.000), e os coeficientes mostram aumento de 0,05 óbitos/100.000 pessoas por mês (p = 0,01) no período pós-introdução da inspeção. Em modelo para os poluentes MP2,5 e CO, em estação de monitoramento da região central do município, não houve correlação entre as concentrações medidas e a introdução ou a suspensão da inspeção. CONCLUSÕES: Não há evidências de que o programa tenha tido qualquer efeito benéfico mensurável sobre a morbidade e a mortalidade por doenças respiratórias e do aparelho circulatório.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have been conducted in other countries on the health effects of exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less P M 10   , but little research has been conducted in Malaysia, particularly during the haze season. This study intends to investigate how exposure of P M 10   influenced hospital admissions for respiratory diseases during the haze period in peninsula Malaysia and it was further stratified by age group, gender and respiratory diseases categories. The study includes data from all patients with respiratory diseases in 92 government hospitals, as well as P M 10   concentration and meteorological data from 92 monitoring stations in Peninsula Malaysia starting from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2019. A quasi-poison time series regression with distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was employed in this study to examine the relationship between exposure of P M 10   and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases during the haze period. Haze period for this study has been defined from June to September each year. According to the findings of this study, P M 10   was positively associated with hospitalisation of respiratory disease within 30 lag days under various lag patterns, with lag 25 showing the strongest association (RR = 1.001742, CI 1.001029,1.002456). Using median as a reference, it was discovered that females were more likely than males to be hospitalized for P M 10   exposure. Working age group will be the most affected by the increase in P M 10   exposure with a significant cumulative RR from lag 010 to lag 030. The study found that P M 10   had a significant influence on respiratory hospitalisation in peninsula Malaysia, particularly for lung diseases caused by external agents(CD5). Therefore, it is important to implement effective intervention measures to control P M 10   and reduce the burden of respiratory disease admissions.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Exposure to particulate matter is associated with various adverse health outcomes. Ultrafine particles (UFPs; diameter <0.1 μm) are a unique public health challenge because of their size. However, limited studies have examined their impacts on human health, especially across seasons and demographic characteristics. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of UFP exposure on the risk of visiting the emergency department (ED) for a chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) in New York State in 2013-2018. Methods: We used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to estimate how UFP exposure led to CLRD-related ED visits. GEOS-Chem Advanced Particle Microphysics, a state-of-the-art chemical transport model with a size-resolved particle microphysics model, generated air pollution simulation data. We then matched UFP exposure estimates to geocoded health records for asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, unspecified bronchitis, and other chronic airway obstructions in New York State from 2013 through 2018. In addition, we assessed interactions with age, ethnicity, race, sex, meteorological factors, and season. Results: Each 1-(interquartile range [IQR]) increase in UFP exposure led to a 0.37% increased risk of a respiratory-related ED visit on lag 0-0, or the day of the ED visits, (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.52%) and a 1.81% increase on lag 0-6, or 6 days before the ED visit, (95% CI, 1.58-2.03%). The highest risk was in the emphysema subtype (lag 0-5, 4.18%; 95% CI, 0.16-8.37%), followed by asthma (lag 0-6, 2.00%), chronic bronchitis (lag 0-6, 1.78%), other chronic airway obstructions (lag 0-6, 1.60%), and unspecified bronchitis (lag 0-6, 1.49%). We also found significant interactions between UFP health impacts and season (Fall, 3.29%), temperature (<90th percentile, 2.27%), relative humidity (>90th percentile, 4.63%), age (children aged <18 yr, 3.19%), and sex (men, 2.06%) on lag 0-6. Conclusions: In this study, UFP exposure increased CLRD-related ED visits across all seasons and demographic characteristics, yet these associations varied according to various factors, which requires more research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute exposure to ambient particulate matter <2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) has been associated with adult psychiatric exacerbations but has not been studied in children. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to estimate the association between acute exposures to ambient PM2.5 and psychiatric emergency department (ED) utilization and to determine if it is modified by community deprivation. METHODS: We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyze all pediatric, psychiatric ED encounters at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 2011 to 2015 (n=13,176). Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature, humidity, and holiday effects were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for a psychiatric ED visit 0-3 d after ambient PM2.5 exposures, estimated at residential addresses using a spatiotemporal model. RESULTS: A 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a significant increase in any psychiatric ED utilization 1 [OR=1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.12)] and 2 [OR=1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10)] d later. When stratified by visit reason, associations were significant for ED visits related to adjustment disorder {e.g., 1-d lag [OR=1.24 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.52)] and suicidality 1-d lag [OR=1.44 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.02)]}. There were significant differences according to community deprivation, with some lags showing stronger associations among children in high versus low deprivation areas for ED visits for anxiety {1-d lag [OR=1.39 (95% CI: 0.96, 2.01) vs. 0.85 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.17)] and suicidality same day [OR=1.98 (95% CI: 1.22, 3.23) vs. 0.93 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.45)]}. In contrast, for some lags, associations with ED visits for adjustment disorder were weaker for children in high-deprivation areas {1-d lag [OR=1.00 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.33) vs. 1.50 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.93)]}. DISCUSSION: These findings warrant additional research to confirm the associations in other populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4815.",

      "abstract": "We estimated the short-term effects of particulate matter (PM) pollution with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and between 2.5 and 10 μm (PMc) on hospital outpatient visits due to overall and specific respiratory diseases, as well as the associated morbidity burden in Dongguan, a subtropical city in South China. A time-series model with quasi-Poisson link was used to examine the association between PM pollution and morbidities from respiratory diseases, COPD, asthma and pneumonia in Dongguan during 2013-2015. We further estimated the morbidity burden (population attributable fraction and attributable morbidity) due to ambient PM pollution. A total of 44,801 hospital outpatient visits for respiratory diseases were recorded during the study period. Both PM2.5 and PMc were found to be significantly associated with morbidity of overall respiratory diseases, COPD, and asthma. An IQR (interquartile range) increase in PM2.5 at lag03 day was associated with 15.41% (95% CI: 10.99%, 20.01%) increase in respiratory morbidity, and each IQR increase in PMc at lag03 corresponded to 7.24% (95% CI: 4.25%, 10.32%) increase in respiratory morbidity. We did not find significant effects of PM2.5 and PMc on pneumonia. Using WHO's guideline (25 μg/m3) as reference concentration, about 8.32% (95% CI: 5.90%, 10.86%) of respiratory morbidity (3727, 95% CI: 2642, 4867, in morbidity number) were estimated to be attributed to PM2.5, and 0.86% (95% CI: 0.50%, 1.23%) of respiratory morbidity, representing 385 (95% CI: 225, 551) hospital outpatient visits, could be attributed to coarse particulate pollutant. Our study suggests that both fine and coarse particulate pollutants are an important trigger of hospital outpatient visits for respiratory diseases, and account for substantial respiratory morbidity in Dongguan, China.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A small number of studies suggested that air pollution was associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exacerbation, incidence and mortality. However, no studies to date were conducted in regions where air pollution is substantial. We aimed to investigate whether there are associations between acute increases in air pollution and hospitalization of patients with a confirmed primary diagnosis of IPF in Beijing. METHODS: Daily count of IPF hospitalizations (International Classification of Disease-10th Revision, J84.1) was obtained from an administrative database for 2013-2017 while daily city-wide average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, Ozone, SO2 were obtained from 35 municipal monitoring stations for the same period. The association between daily IPF hospitalization and average concentration of each pollutant was analyzed with a generalized additive model estimating Poisson distribution. RESULTS: Daily 24-h mean PM2.5 concentration during 2013-2017 was 76.7 μg/m3. The relative risk (RR) of IPF hospitalization per interquartile range (IQR) higher (72 μg/m3) in PM2.5 was 1.049 (95% CI 1.024-1.074) and 1.031 (95% CI 1.007-1.056) for lag0 and moving averages 0-1 days respectively. No significant associations were observed for other lags. Statistically significant positive associations were also observed at lag0 with SO2, Ozone and NO2 (in men only). Positive associations were seen at moving averages 0-30 days for PM10 (RR per 86 μg/m3: 1.021, 95% CI 0.994-1.049), NO2 (RR per 30 μg/m3: 1.029, 95% CI 0.999-1.060), and SO2 (RR per 15 μg/m3: 1.060 (95% CI 1.025-1.097), but not with PM2.5 or Ozone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in air quality since the implementation of clean air policy in 2013, acute exposure to higher levels of air pollution is significantly associated with IPF hospitalization in Beijing. Air quality policy should be continuously enforced to protect vulnerable IPF populations as well as the general public.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative potential (OP) has been proposed as a measure of toxicity of ambient particulate matter (PM). OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to address an important research gap by using daily OP measurements to conduct population-level analysis of the health effects of measured ambient OP. METHODS: A semi-automated dithiothreitol (DTT) analytical system was used to measure daily average OP (OPDTT) in water-soluble fine PM at a central monitor site in Atlanta, Georgia, over eight sampling periods (a total of 196 d) during June 2012-April 2013. Data on emergency department (ED) visits for selected cardiorespiratory outcomes were obtained for the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area. Poisson log-linear regression models controlling for temporal confounders were used to conduct time-series analyses of the relationship between daily counts of ED visits and either the 3-d moving average (lag 0-2) of OPDTT or same-day OPDTT. Bipollutant regression models were run to estimate the health associations of OPDTT while controlling for other pollutants. RESULTS: OPDTT was measured for 196 d (mean=0.32 nmol/min/m3, interquartile range=0.21). Lag 0-2 OPDTT was associated with ED visits for respiratory disease (RR=1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.05 per interquartile range increase in OPDTT), asthma (RR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.22), and ischemic heart disease (RR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.38). Same-day OPDTT was not associated with ED visits for any outcome. Lag 0-2 OPDTT remained a significant predictor of asthma and ischemic heart disease in most bipollutant models. CONCLUSIONS: Lag 0-2 OPDTT was associated with ED visits for multiple cardiorespiratory outcomes, providing support for the utility of OPDTT as a measure of fine particle toxicity. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1545.",

      "title": "Associations of Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "abstract": "Air pollution has been associated with poor health outcomes and continues to be a risk factor for respiratory health in children. While higher particulate matter (PM) levels are associated with increased frequency of symptoms, lower lung function, and increase airway inflammation from asthma, the precise composition of the particles that are more highly associated with poor health outcomes or healthcare utilization are not fully elucidated. PM is measured quantifiably by current air pollution monitoring systems. To better determine sources of PM and speciation of such sources, a particulate matter (PM) source apportionment study, the Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutant Study (CMAPS), was conducted in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2009-2010, which allowed more refined assessment of associations with health outcomes. This article presents an evaluation of short-term (daily) and long-term associations between motor vehicle and industrial air pollution components and pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits by evaluating two sets of air quality data with healthcare utilization for pediatric asthma. Exposure estimates were developed using land use regression models for long-term exposures for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and coarse (i.e., with aerodynamic diameters between 2.5 and 10 μm) particulate matter (PM) and the US EPA Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model for short-term exposures to fine (<2.5 μm) and coarse PM components. Exposure metrics from these two approaches were used in asthma ED visit prevalence and time series analyses to investigate seasonal-averaged short- and long-term impacts of both motor vehicles and industry emissions. Increased pediatric asthma ED visits were found for LUR coarse PM and NO2 estimates, which were primarily contributed by motor vehicles. Consistent, statistically significant associations with pediatric asthma visits were observed, with short-term exposures to components of fine and coarse iron PM associated with steel production. Our study is the first to combine spatial and time series analysis of ED visits for asthma using the same periods and shows that PM related to motor vehicle emissions and iron/steel production are associated with increased pediatric asthma visits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence has reported positive associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Inconsistent findings have been reported for short-term air pollution, mostly from ecological study designs. Using individual-level data, we studied the association between short-term variation in air pollutants [nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with a diameter of <2.5 µm (PM2.5) and a diameter of <10 µm (PM10) and ozone (O3)] and hospital admission among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The COVAIR-CAT (Air pollution in relation to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality: a large population-based cohort study in Catalonia, Spain) cohort is a large population-based cohort in Catalonia, Spain including 240 902 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the primary care system from 1 March until 31 December 2020. Our outcome was hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. We used individual residential address to assign daily air-pollution exposure, estimated using machine-learning methods for spatiotemporal prediction. For each pandemic wave, we fitted Cox proportional-hazards models accounting for non-linear-distributed lagged exposure over the previous 7 days. RESULTS: Results differed considerably by pandemic wave. During the second wave, an interquartile-range increase in cumulative weekly exposure to air pollution (lag0_7) was associated with a 12% increase (95% CI: 4% to 20%) in COVID-19 hospitalizations for NO2, 8% (95% CI: 1% to 16%) for PM2.5 and 9% (95% CI: 3% to 15%) for PM10. We observed consistent positive associations for same-day (lag0) exposure, whereas lag-specific associations beyond lag0 were generally not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests positive associations between NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 and hospitalization risk among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 during the second wave. Cumulative hazard ratios were largely driven by exposure on the same day as hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) as measured by serum cotinine and healthcare utilization among children. METHODS: In 2016, the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were analyzed including 4,985 children aged 3-19 years. Associations between SHSe and having a routine place for healthcare, type of place, and hospital utilization were examined using logistic regression models. Poisson regression analyses assessed the relationship between SHSe and number of hospital admissions. Relationships between SHSe and acute care visits and hospital utilization were examined among asthmatic children. RESULTS: SHSe level did not differ by having a routine place for healthcare, although children with high SHSe indicative of active smoking (cotinine ≥3 ng/mL) were 3.49 times (95% CI=1.77, 6.89) more likely to use an emergency department. Children with high SHSe were 2.85 times (95% CI=1.87, 4.34) more likely to have had an overnight hospital stay. Children with high SHSe had 2.05 times (95% CI=1.46, 2.87) the risk of having a higher number of hospital admissions for overnight stays versus children with no SHSe (cotinine <0.05 ng/mL). Among asthmatic children, those with high SHSe and low SHSe (cotinine 0.05-2.99 ng/mL) were more likely to have an acute care visit, overnight hospital stay, and higher number of hospital admissions than asthmatic children with no SHSe. CONCLUSIONS: High SHSe is associated with increased healthcare utilization. The emergency department and inpatient settings are important venues in which to routinely offer cessation and SHSe reduction interventions.",

      "abstract": "Data from recent experimental and clinical studies have indicated that lower concentrations of inhaled carbon monoxide might have beneficial antiinflammatory effects. Inhaled carbon monoxide has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). However, population-based epidemiologic studies of environmentally relevant carbon monoxide exposure have generated mixed findings. We conducted a time-series study in Hong Kong to estimate the association of short-term exposure to ambient carbon monoxide with emergency hospitalizations for COPD. We collected daily emergency hospital admission data and air pollution data from January 2001 to December 2007. We used log-linear Poisson models to estimate the associations between daily hospital admissions for COPD and the average daily concentrations of carbon monoxide while controlling for the traffic-related co-pollutants nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm. Results showed that ambient carbon monoxide was negatively associated with the risk of hospitalizations for COPD. After adjustment for levels nitrogen dioxide or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm, the negative associations of carbon monoxide with COPD hospitalizations became stronger. The risk estimates were similar for female and male subjects. In conclusion, short-term exposure to ambient carbon monoxide was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization for COPD, which suggests that carbon monoxide exposure provides some acute protection of against exacerbation of COPD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution is thought to contribute to increased risk of COVID-19, but the evidence is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between short-term variations in outdoor concentrations of ambient air pollution and COVID-19 emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover study of 78 255 COVID-19 ED visits in Alberta and Ontario, Canada between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. Daily air pollution data (ie, fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone were assigned to individual case of COVID-19 in 10 km × 10 km grid resolution. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate associations between air pollution and ED visits for COVID-19. RESULTS: Cumulative ambient exposure over 0-3 days to PM2.5 (OR 1.010; 95% CI 1.004 to 1.015, per 6.2 µg/m3) and NO2 (OR 1.021; 95% CI 1.015 to 1.028, per 7.7 ppb) concentrations were associated with ED visits for COVID-19. We found that the association between PM2.5 and COVID-19 ED visits was stronger among those hospitalised following an ED visit, as a measure of disease severity, (OR 1.023; 95% CI 1.015 to 1.031) compared with those not hospitalised (OR 0.992; 95% CI 0.980 to 1.004) (p value for effect modification=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We found associations between short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and COVID-19 ED visits. Exposure to air pollution may also lead to more severe COVID-19 disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The length of hospital stay (LOS) is a proxy of asthma exacerbation severity and healthcare cost. The study aims to estimate the effect of ambient air pollution on pediatric asthma LOS in the Bronx, NY. METHODS: A total of 1,920 children admitted to the hospital in Bronx, NY due to asthma during 2017-2019 period were included in the study. Demographic and clinical parameters were obtained from medical records. Daily ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measurements were obtained from local air quality networks. Poisson regression adjusting for gender, age, weight status, respiratory infections including influenza, and ambient temperature was applied to determine whether there was an association of air pollution with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The mean LOS varied by age, sex, weight status, influenza vaccination status, respiratory viral panel (RVP) results, asthma controller use, and asthma classification. After controlling for these factors in Poisson regression, the mean LOS increased up to 10.62% (95%CI: 0.78-21.41; p = 0.03) for an increase of 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 exposure on admission day, and 3.90% (95%CI = 0.06-7.88; p = 0.05) for an increase of 10 ppbv of O3 concentration during the previous day. CONCLUSION: Ambient particulate and ozone pollution is associated with lengthier hospital stays for pediatric asthma, potentially indicating more severe asthma exacerbations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prescribed agricultural burning is a common land management practice, but little is known about the health effects from the resulting smoke exposure. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between smoke from prescribed burning and cardiorespiratory outcomes in the U.S. state of Kansas. METHODS: We analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits for February-May (months when prescribed burning is common in Kansas) in the years 2009-2011 (n = 109,220). Given limited monitoring data, we formulated a measure of smoke exposure using non-traditional datasets, including fire radiative power and locational attributes from remote sensing data sources. We then assigned a population-weighted potential smoke impact factor (PSIF) to each zip code, based on fire intensity, smoke transport, and fire proximity. We used Poisson generalized linear models to estimate the association between PSIF on the same day and in the past 3 days and asthma, respiratory including asthma, and cardiovascular ED visits. RESULTS: During the study period, prescribed burning took place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas. Same-day PSIF was associated with a 7% increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for month, year, zip code, meteorology, day of week, holidays, and correlation within zip codes (rate ratio [RR]: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.13). Same-day PSIF was not associated with a combined outcome of respiratory ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02]), or cardiovascular ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 1.01 [0.98, 1.04]). There was no consistent association between PSIF during the past 3 days and any of the outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest an association between smoke exposure and asthma ED visits on the same day. Elucidating these associations will help guide public health programs that address population-level exposure to smoke from prescribed burning.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine if and how environmental factors correlated with asthma admission rates in geographically different parts of Guangxi province in China. SETTING: Guangxi, China. PARTICIPANTS: This study was done among 7804 asthma patients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Spearman correlation coefficient was used to estimate correlation between environmental factors and asthma hospitalisation rates in multiple regions. Generalised additive model (GAM) with Poisson regression was used to estimate effects of environmental factors on asthma hospitalisation rates in 14 regions of Guangxi. RESULTS: The strongest effect of carbon monoxide (CO) was found on lag1 in Hechi, and every 10 µg/m3 increase of CO caused an increase of 25.6% in asthma hospitalisation rate (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.55). According to the correlation analysis, asthma hospitalisations were related to the daily temperature, daily range of temperature, CO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) in multiple regions. According to the result of GAM, the adjusted R2 was high in Beihai and Nanning, with values of 0.29 and 0.21, which means that environmental factors are powerful in explaining changes of asthma hospitalisation rates in Beihai and Nanning. CONCLUSION: Asthma hospitalisation rate was significantly and more strongly associated with CO than with NO2, SO2 or PM2.5 in Guangxi. The risk factors of asthma exacerbations were not consistent in different regions, indicating that targeted measures should differ between regions.",

This study aimed to examine the association between AD exposure and hospitalization due to pneumonia. Data on patients in Western Japan admitted for pneumonia were included from a real-world database derived from electronic medical records. We used the meteorological observatory data of the most populous city in each prefecture, in which AD event was defined as a loss of visibility from a distance ≤10 km. A case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression model were used. Overall, 12 938 patients were included, and AD exposure events were observed for 557 days. Exposure to an AD event five days prior to hospitalization was significantly associated with hospitalization for pneumonia after adjusting for weather variables (odds ratio = 1.17). These findings suggest that AD exposure is associated with an increased rate of admission for pneumonia in Western Japan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition. Few studies have evaluated the relationship between air pollution and PE, and these results have been inconsistent. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the association between air pollutant exposure and the risk of hospitalization due to PE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily PE admissions, meteorological data, and ambient pollution data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, were collected in Beijing. A quasi-Poisson regression model combined with time-stratified case-crossover design and a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to determine the effect of air pollutant exposure on PE admission. To examine the stability of air pollutants' effects, multi-pollutant analyses were performed. Stratified analyses by age and sex were further conducted. RESULTS: There were 5060 PE admissions during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 6.5 per 100,000. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and CO exposures were significantly associated with elevated risk of PE hospitalization. The highest cumulative risks were observed at a lag of 0-28 days for PM2.5 (relative risk [RR] = 1.056, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.015-1.098), PM10 (RR = 1.042, 95%CI: 1.010-1.075), and CO (RR = 1.466, 95%CI: 1.127-1.906), at a lag of 0-27 days for SO2 (RR = 1.674, 95%CI: 1.200-2.335), and at a lag of 0-4 days for O3 (RR = 1.019, 95%CI: 1.001-1.038). All associations mentioned above except O3 remained significant in multi-pollutant models. Stratified analyses showed that women and those aged ≥65 years people were more sensitive to PM10 and CO exposure than men and those aged <65 years. The effect of PM2.5 exposure was statistically significant in all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO showed a positive association with PE hospitalization. High-risk PE groups should take special precautions on days with poor air quality.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: The relationship between air pollution and pneumonia is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine relationships between short-term air pollution exposure and number and severity of pneumonia cases along the Wasatch Front in Utah, a region with periodic high levels of outdoor air pollution. METHODS: We applied time-stratified case-crossover analyses with distributed lag to patients presenting to seven emergency departments with pneumonia over a 2-year period. We compared levels of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone at patient residences with emergency department cases, hospitalizations, objectively defined severe pneumonia, and mortality. We calculated direct cost impacts of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter reduction. RESULTS: We evaluated 4,336 pneumonia cases in seven hospitals. Among adults aged 65 years and older, we found consistently positive associations between particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter within 6 days of presentation and instances of pneumonia (Lag Day 1 adjusted odds ratio, 1.35 per 10 μg/m3 over 12 μg/m3; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.57), severe pneumonia (Lag Day 1 adjusted odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.80), and inpatient mortality (Lag Day 5 adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.16). Smaller associations were found between nitrogen dioxide exposure and pneumonia occurrence, severity, and inpatient and 30-day mortality. Ozone exposure was modestly associated with increased instance and severity of pneumonia in younger adults. Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter and nitrogen dioxide effects were greatest in colder months, and ozone effects were greatest in warmer months. Reduction of particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter levels to less than 12.0 mg/m3 could prevent 76-112 cases of pneumonia per year in these hospitals serving approximately half of the Wasatch Front's population, reducing direct medical facility costs by $807,000 annually. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, short-term ambient particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter exposure is associated with more emergency department visits and hospitalizations for pneumonia, severe pneumonia, increased mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone modestly increase pneumonia risk and illness severity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported significant associations between exposure to PM(2.5) and hospital admissions, but all have focused on the effects of short-term exposure. In addition all these studies have relied on a limited number of PM(2.5) monitors in their study regions, which introduces exposure error, and excludes rural and suburban populations from locations in which monitors are not available, reducing generalizability and potentially creating selection bias. METHODS: Using our novel prediction models for exposure combining land use regression with physical measurements (satellite aerosol optical depth) we investigated both the long and short term effects of PM(2.5) exposures on hospital admissions across New-England for all residents aged 65 and older. We performed separate Poisson regression analysis for each admission type: all respiratory, cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke and diabetes. Daily admission counts in each zip code were regressed against long and short-term PM(2.5) exposure, temperature, socio-economic data and a spline of time to control for seasonal trends in baseline risk. RESULTS: We observed associations between both short-term and long-term exposure to PM(2.5) and hospitalization for all of the outcomes examined. In example, for respiratory diseases, for every 10-µg/m(3) increase in short-term PM(2.5) exposure there is a 0.70 percent increase in admissions (CI = 0.35 to 0.52) while concurrently for every 10-µg/m(3) increase in long-term PM(2.5) exposure there is a 4.22 percent increase in admissions (CI = 1.06 to 4.75). CONCLUSIONS: As with mortality studies, chronic exposure to particles is associated with substantially larger increases in hospital admissions than acute exposure and both can be detected simultaneously using our exposure models.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Dust storms are projected to increase with climate change. The short-term health outcomes associated with dust storms in the US are not well characterized, especially for morbidity outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate associations between dust storms and diagnosis-specific emergency department (ED) visits during 2005 to 2018. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study using a time-stratified case-crossover design, short-term associations between dust storms and ED visits were estimated at the zip code level using conditional Poisson analysis with adjustment for meteorology and within-month trends. Same-day dust storm events and storm events within a lag period of up to 7 days were considered. State-wide patient-level ED visit records acquired from 3 state health departments (Arizona, California, and Utah) were analyzed. Data were analyzed between April 21 and November 12, 2024. EXPOSURES: Dust storm events were reported by the US National Weather Service and assigned to each patient zip code that had at least a 5% areal overlap with the National Weather Service forecast zone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient-level ED visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, culture-negative pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and visits due to motor vehicle accidents. RESULTS: The analysis included 33 500 ED visits among the outcomes of interest (5717 children aged 0-17 years [17.1%] and 11 150 adults aged >65 years [33.3%]; 17 394 male [51.9%] and 16 104 female [48.1%]; 2829 Black [8.4%] and 22 537 White [67.2%]; 9256 Hispanic [27.6%]) and 206 dust-impacted zip codes. The strongest associations between dust storms and ED visits were found for asthma (lag 0-2 relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03), culture-negative pneumonia (lag 0-7 RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P = .002), CHF (lag 0-7 RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P = .01), and motor vehicle accidents (lag 0 RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23; P = .003). Associations of dust storm exposure with ischemic heart disease were mostly protective (eg, lag 0-2 RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95; P < .001). Associations of dust storm exposure with risk of ED visits for CHF and motor vehicle accidents were robust against adjustment for ambient ozone (eg, CHF: RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; P = .003) and nitrogen dioxide (eg, CHF: RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; P = .003) air pollution. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, dust storms were positively associated with ED visits for asthma, pneumonia, heart failure, and motor vehicle accidents. These findings contribute to our understanding of the association of dust storms with morbidity in the US and potential outcomes under a changing climate.",

Here we quantified air pollution-related acute health effects and related economic losses of the most common two respiratory diseases in southwestern China, acute bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We applied a distributed lag non-linear model to analyse the relationship between ambient air pollutants and hospital admissions of acute bronchitis and COPD, then applied the cost of illness method to explore the attributing economic burden. During the study period, 528 334 and 99 419 hospital admissions of acute bronchitis and COPD, respectively, were recorded. As a result, during the study period the total hospitalization economic losses attributable to air pollution were 486.40 and 254.74 million yuan for acute bronchitis and COPD, respectively, accounting for 0.015% of local gross domestic product. Our research provides intuitive evidence on the health and economic impacts of short-term exposure to air pollution, which is a key basis for the formulation of environmental policies.",

      "abstract": "Among various aspects of environmental epidemiology, one is to assess the relationships between ambient air pollution and health outcomes. The goal of this work is to estimate the associations in the form of the parametric concentration-response functions (C-RF). Various forms of the C-RFs are proposed in this short-term health effect study. Emergency department (ED) visits for all respiratory health problems are analyzed as an illustrative example. A case-crossover (CC) technique is applied as a study design. Daily cases are organized as daily counts by the same day of the week in one common month. A conditional Poisson regression is used in the constructed statistical models. Temperature and relative humidity are included in the statistical models in the form of natural splines. Ground-level ozone concentration is considered an exposure. Ozone concentration values are transformed and submitted to the statistical models. The parameters of the transformation are determined by using the goodness of fit criterion. Counts of ED visits are analyzed in relation to a sequence of lagged exposure to ozone. The C-RF shapes are constructed for each individual lag. In a final step, the set of the estimated C-RF shapes is used to create a pooled C-RF shape. The results are positive and statistically significant for nine lagged exposures, from 0 to 8 days. The following relative risks (RR) were estimated from the constructed C-RFs at 30 ppb concentration of ozone: RR = 1.0531 (95% confidence interval: 1.0231, 1.0718), 1.0462 (1.0253, 1.0677), and 1.0387, (1.0240, 1.0531), realizing the CC method, CC method + transformation, and CC method + flexible transformation, respectively. The pooled C-RF shape gives a summary of the associations between ED visits for respiratory conditions and ambient ozone. The estimated shapes indicate lower air health effects than the standard CC methods. Among three considered statistical models, the CC method + flexible transformation is the most appropriate to use according to the goodness of fit criterion.",

Daily time-series analyses tested the association between daily ED visit and air pollutants and components of particulates measured in Santiago Centro, a municipality, which includes downtown Santiago during the period from 2001 to 2006. The strongest individual effect was seen for elemental carbon. A 4.76 microg/m3 increase was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.14) increase in total ED visits, and a RR of 1.18 (95% CI = 1.16-1.21) for respiratory ED visit. Using factor analysis, the authors determined that traffic combustion-related particulates were significantly associated with ED visits. Among all the sources identified, traffic combustion-related particulates had the strongest association with ED visits. A factor indicating soil-sourced particles had a weaker but statistically significant observed morbidity effect. Of the many components of particulate air pollution, those from motor vehicle exhaust had the greatest observed effect on morbidity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Abrupt changes in air pollution levels associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak present a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of air pollution on influenza risk, at a time when emission sources were less active and personal hygiene practices were more rigorous. METHODS: This time-series study examined the relationship between influenza cases (n=22 874) and air pollutant concentrations from 2018 to 2021, comparing the timeframes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in and around Thailand's Khon Kaen province. Poisson generalized additive modeling was employed to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization for influenza associated with air pollutant levels. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 outbreak, both the average daily number of influenza hospitalizations and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) concentration exceeded those later observed during the pandemic (p&lt;0.001). In single-pollutant models, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 before COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased influenza risk upon exposure to cumulative-day lags, specifically lags 0-5 and 0-6 (p&lt;0.01). After adjustment for co-pollutants, PM2.5 demonstrated the strongest effects at lags 0 and 4, with elevated risk found across all cumulative-day lags (0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 0-5, and 0-6) and significantly greater risk in the winter and summer at lag 0-5 (p&lt;0.01). However, the PM2.5 level was not significantly associated with influenza risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the risk of PM2.5-induced influenza. Effective regulatory actions in the context of COVID-19 may decrease PM2.5 emissions and improve hygiene practices, thereby reducing influenza hospitalizations.",

Pearson's coefficient correlation was used for the study variables. To estimate the association between hospitalizations due to asthma and air pollutants, Poisson regression generalized additive models were built, according to lags of up to seven days. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between hospitalizations and the pollutants particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. Exposure to particulate matter and sulfur dioxide were associated with significant relative risks of 1.01 to 1.04 of hospitalization due to asthma on the same day and within three days after exposure. Increases in the concentrations of these pollutants increase the risk of hospitalization between 8% and 19%.

      "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is a reactive oxidant exerting both inflammatory and oxidative damages to the respiratory system. With the ground-level O3 progressively increasing in the past decade, the reevaluation of the pneumonia hospitalization risk from exposure to O3 is of public health interest. We conducted an ecological time-series study to examine the city-specific association between short-term O3 exposure and pneumonia hospitalizations in Hong Kong and Taipei, respectively. We linked the daily pneumonia hospitalization count to air pollution concentrations and weather conditions according to the date of admission during 2010-2017. We applied a generalized additive distributed lag model to examine the association while adjusting for time-varying covariates. Stratified analysis by age group and the potential harvesting effect of O3 were evaluated. We observed the harvesting effects of O3 on pneumonia hospitalizations in children in both cities and adults in Taipei. The short-term effect of O3 lasted for around one week. An interquartile range (IQR) increment of daytime 8-hour mean concentration of O3 distributed over 0-6 lag days in Hong Kong (42.4 μg/m3) was associated with a 7.04% (95% CI: 5.35-8.76%) increase in hospital admissions for elderly pneumonia, while the corresponding cumulative excess risk per IQR increment of O3 in Taipei (38.7 μg/m3) was 3.41% (95% CI: 1.63-5.22%). Different O3 metrics, varying degrees of freedom for filtering the temporal trend, and three-pollutant models supported the robustness of the associations. We concluded that short-term O3 exposure was associated with pneumonia hospitalizations in the elderly population. Understanding the pneumonia hospitalization risk of O3 will help to inform public health policies in the planning of ozone control strategies and intervention measures to prevent ozone-related pneumonia in vulnerable elderly populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The harmful effect of dust storm on lung health is controversial. This study aimed to assess any associations between dust storms and emergency hospital admissions due to respiratory disease in Hong Kong. METHODS: Data on daily emergency admissions for respiratory diseases to major hospitals in Hong Kong, and indices of air pollutants and meteorological variables from January 1998 to December 2002 were obtained from several government departments. We identified five dust storm days during the study period. Independent t-tests were used to compare the mean daily number of admissions on dust storm and non-dust storm days. Case-crossover analysis using the Poisson regression was used to examine the effects of PM(10) to emergency hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Significant increases in emergency hospital admission due to COPD were found 2 days after dust storm episode. The relative risk of PM(10) for lag 2 days was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.09) per 10 µg/m(3) . CONCLUSIONS: Dust storms have an adverse effect on emergency hospital admission for COPD in Hong Kong. This also suggests the adverse effect of coarse particles on lung health.",

      "title": "Association between respiratory hospital admissions and air quality in Portugal: A count time series approach.",
      "abstract": "Although regulatory improvements for air quality in the European Union have been made, air pollution is still a pressing problem and, its impact on health, both mortality and morbidity, is a topic of intense research nowadays. The main goal of this work is to assess the impact of the exposure to air pollutants on the number of daily hospital admissions due to respiratory causes in 58 spatial locations of Portugal mainland, during the period 2005-2017. To this end, INteger Generalised AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (INGARCH)-based models are extensively used. This family of models has proven to be very useful in the analysis of serially dependent count data. Such models include information on the past history of the time series, as well as the effect of external covariates. In particular, daily hospitalisation counts, air quality and temperature data are endowed within INGARCH models of optimal orders, where the automatic inclusion of the most significant covariates is carried out through a new block-forward procedure. The INGARCH approach is adequate to model the outcome variable (respiratory hospital admissions) and the covariates, which advocates for the use of count time series approaches in this setting. Results show that the past history of the count process carries very relevant information and that temperature is the most determinant covariate, among the analysed, for daily hospital respiratory admissions. It is important to stress that, despite the small variability explained by air quality, all models include on average, approximately two air pollutants covariates besides temperature. Further analysis shows that the one-step-ahead forecasts distributions are well separated into two clusters: one cluster includes locations exclusively in the Lisbon area (exhibiting higher number of one-step-ahead hospital admissions forecasts), while the other contains the remaining locations. This results highlights that special attention must be given to air quality in Lisbon metropolitan area in order to decrease the number of hospital admissions.",
