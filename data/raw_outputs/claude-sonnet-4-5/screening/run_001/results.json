However, the abstract does not specifically mention PM2.5 as an exposure - it only refers to 'air pollutants' and 'air quality' generically. Additionally, while the abstract mentions that air pollutants were included as covariates and models were developed, it does not explicitly state whether quantitative effect estimates (RR, OR, or equivalent with confidence intervals) for specific pollutants including PM2.5 are reported. The study appears to be original research published as a full article, but without confirmation that PM2.5 was analyzed and that effect estimates are provided, inclusion cannot be definitively determined from this abstract alone.",
