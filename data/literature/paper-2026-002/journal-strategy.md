## Recommendation

| Tier | Journal | IF | APC | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----|-----|-----------|
| **A (Primary)** | **Research Synthesis Methods** | 6.1 | $3,570 (hybrid) | Premier journal for evidence synthesis methodology; already published LLM+SR papers; directly addresses our audience |
| **A (Alt)** | **J Clinical Epidemiology** | ~5.0 | ~$3,500 (hybrid) | Published scoping review flagging LLM reproducibility as open question (Lieberum 2025); SJR=3.149 |
| **B (Strong)** | **npj Digital Medicine** | 15.1 | $3,790 (OA) | Highest IF; needs broader framing beyond env health; competitive |
| **B (Alt)** | **JAMIA** | 6.4 | ~$3,580 (hybrid) | Active LLM special issue; informatics community |
| **C (Backup)** | **Royal Society Open Science** | 2.9 | ~$1,500 (OA) | Cheapest APC; strong reproducibility ethos |
| **C (Alt)** | **Environment International** | 11.8 | $3,790 (OA) | High IF but scope stretch for methods paper |

## Detailed Analysis: Top 3

### A1. Research Synthesis Methods (Cambridge University Press)

**Why #1:**
- **Scope fit: PERFECT** — "Methods for designing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting systematic research synthesis"
- Already published:
  - "Compact large language models for title and abstract screening in systematic reviews" (2025)
  - "Generative artificial intelligence use in evidence synthesis: A systematic review" (2025)
- Our paper directly answers questions raised in their recent publications
- Hybrid: can publish subscription-access for **free** (no APC)
- Review timeline: ~14 weeks

**Formatting constraints to note:**
- No explicit word limit (but typically 6,000-10,000 words for full articles)
- Figures: high resolution, publication-ready
- Supplementary materials: encouraged
- Data availability statement: required
- Code availability: expected

---

### A2. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (Elsevier)

**Why strong alternative:**
- SJR=3.149 (outsized influence for its IF)
- Published Lieberum et al. 2025 scoping review: *"Large language models for conducting systematic reviews: on the rise, but not yet ready for use"* — our paper provides the empirical evidence they called for
- Audience: systematic reviewers, guideline developers, HTA agencies
- Hybrid journal (subscription option = no APC)

---

### B1. npj Digital Medicine (Nature Partner Journal)

**Why high-impact option:**
- IF = 15.1 (highest on list)
- Published TrialMind (2025) and multiple LLM clinical papers
- Fully OA: $3,790 APC
- **Caveat:** needs framing that emphasizes generalizable framework, not just PM2.5 case
- Very competitive (Nature-branded)

---

## Decision

**Submit to: Research Synthesis Methods (A1)**
- Best scope fit
- Receptive editorial stance toward LLM methods papers
- Free subscription-access publication
- If declined: J Clinical Epidemiology (A2)
- If seeking max impact: npj Digital Medicine (B1) with broader framing

**Important note:** Environmental Health Perspectives (IF=10.1) stopped accepting submissions in April 2025 (transitioning to ACS Publications). Monitor for reopening.
