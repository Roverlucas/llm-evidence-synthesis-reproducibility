      "abstract": "We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the relationship between air pollutants and hospital admissions for respiratory and non-respiratory diseases in six metropolitan cities in South Korea. This study compared the associations between particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and hospital admission for respiratory and non-respiratory diseases before (2016-2019) and during (2020) the implementation of COVID-19 NPIs by using distributed lag non-linear models. In the Pre-COVID-19 period, the association between PM10 and admission risk for asthma and COPD showed an inverted U-shaped pattern. For PM2.5, S-shaped and inverted U-shaped changes were observed in asthma and COPD, respectively. Extremely high and low levels of PM10 and extremely low levels of PM2.5 significantly decreased the risk of admission for asthma and COPD. In the Post-COVID-19 outbreak period, the overall cumulative relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 and respiratory diseases and the effects of extreme levels of PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory diseases were completely changed. For non-respiratory diseases, PM10 and PM2.5 were statistically insignificant for admission risk during both periods. Our study may provide evidence that implementing NPIs and reducing PM10 and PM2.5 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to reducing hospital admissions for environment-based respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: As the results from epidemiological studies about the impact of outdoor air pollution on asthma in children are heterogeneous, our objective was to investigate the association between asthma exacerbation in children and exposure to air pollutants. METHODS: A database of 1 264 585 paediatric visits during the 2010-2015 period to the emergency rooms from 20 emergency departments (EDs) of 'Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP)', the largest hospital group in Europe, was used. A total of 47 107 visits were classified as asthma exacerbations. Concentration of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, fine particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10  µm (PM10) and 2.5 µm (PM2.5)), as well as meteorological data, evolution of respiratory syncytial virus infection and pollen exposition, were collected on an hourly or daily basis for the same period using institutional databases. To assess the association between air pollution and asthma, mixed-effects quasi-Poisson regression modelling was performed. RESULTS: The only compound independently associated with ED visits for asthma was PM2.5 (P<10-4). The association between asthma exacerbation and PM2.5 was not linear, and a sigmoid function described the relationshipsatisfactorily. PM2.5 concentration, which gives half the maximum effect, was estimated at 13.5 µg/m3. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between daily asthma exacerbation in paediatric visits to the ED and fine particulate air pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Risk of asthma hospitalization and its disparities associated with air pollutant exposures are less clear within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, particularly at low degrees of exposure. Objectives: To assess effects of short-term exposures to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ⩽2.5 μm [PM2.5]), warm-season ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on risk of asthma hospitalization among national Medicaid beneficiaries, the most disadvantaged population in the United States, and to test whether any subpopulations were at higher risk. Methods: We constructed a time-stratified case-crossover dataset among 1,627,002 hospitalizations during 2000-2012 and estimated risk of asthma hospitalization associated with short-term PM2.5, O3, and NO2 exposures. We then restricted the analysis to hospitalizations with degrees of exposure below increasingly stringent thresholds. Furthermore, we tested effect modifications by individual- and community-level characteristics. Measurements and Main Results: Each 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1-ppb increase in O3, and 1-ppb increase in NO2 was associated with 0.31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.37%), 0.10% (95% CI, 0.05 - 0.15%), and 0.28% (95% CI, 0.24 - 0.32%) increase in risk of asthma hospitalization, respectively. Low-level PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with higher risk. Furthermore, beneficiaries with only one asthma hospitalization during the study period or in communities with lower population density, higher average body mass index, longer distance to the nearest hospital, or greater neighborhood deprivation experienced higher risk. Conclusions: Short-term air pollutant exposures increased risk of asthma hospitalization among Medicaid beneficiaries, even at concentrations well below national standards. The subgroup differences suggested individual and contextual factors contributed to asthma disparities under effects of air pollutant exposures.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Outdoor air pollution causes emergency department visits and hospitalizations for childhood asthma. In the United States, the Air Quality Index (AQI) alerts the public to air quality and provides behavioral recommendations to reduce exposure and harm, yet little is known about the relationship between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations. Objectives: To test for association between the AQI and childhood asthma exacerbations resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Methods: This was a retrospective time-stratified case-crossover study, conducted using medical records data from 2010 through 2018 for children aged 6-17 years with a primary diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency department visit or hospitalization for asthma) at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Daily AQI data was obtained for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from the Environmental Protection Agency. Conditional logistic regression was used for analyses of the AQI (as both a continuous and categorical variable) and asthma exacerbations. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore modification of the AQI effects on asthma exacerbations by race and other covariates. Results: There were 6,573 events. Particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) was the primary pollutant responsible for the AQI, followed by ozone (62% and 29% of days with events, respectively). The overall AQI was associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., as continuous, per 10-unit increase, Lag Day 2: odds ratio [OR], 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.025; Lag Day 3: OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001-1.023). By pollutant-specific AQI, the association was strongest for PM2.5. In stratified analyses, the AQI was associated with exacerbations in Black and younger children (6-11 yr) on Lag Day 4. Conclusions: The AQI is associated with asthma exacerbations among children in Allegheny County. This is driven primarily by PM2.5, with Black and younger children particularly affected. Healthcare providers should discuss the AQI in asthma management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is positively associated with acute cardiovascular and respiratory events. Understanding whether this association varies across specific cardiovascular and respiratory conditions has important biologic, clinical, and public health implications. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of hospitalizations from 2000 through 2014 among United States Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+. The outcomes were hospitalizations with any of 57 cardiovascular and 32 respiratory discharge diagnoses. We estimated associations with two-day moving average PM2.5 as a piecewise linear term with a knot at PM2.5 = 25 g/m3. We used Multi-Outcome Regression with Tree-structured Shrinkage (MOReTreeS) to identify de novo groups of related diseases such that PM2.5 associations are: (1) similar within outcome groups; but (2) different between outcome groups. We adjusted for temperature, humidity, and individual-level characteristics. We introduce an R package, moretrees. RESULTS: Our dataset included 16,007,293 cardiovascular and 8,690,837 respiratory hospitalizations. Of 57 cardiovascular diseases, 51 were grouped and positively associated with PM2.5. We observed a stronger positive association for heart failure, which formed a separate group. We observed negative associations for groups containing the outcomes other aneurysm and intracranial hemorrhage. Of 32 respiratory outcomes, 31 were grouped and were positively associated with PM2.5. Influenza formed a separate group with a negative association. CONCLUSIONS: We used a new statistical approach, MOReTreeS, to uncover variation in the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory causes controlling for patient characteristics, time trends, and environmental confounders.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of air pollutants on hospital admissions for respiratory disease (RD) by using distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) in Lanzhou during 2014-2019. In this study, the dataset of air pollutants, meteorological, and daily hospital admissions for RD in Lanzhou, from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2019, were collected from three national environmental monitoring stations, China meteorological data service center, and three large general hospitals, respectively. A time-series analysis with DLNM was used to estimate the associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions for RD including the stratified analysis of age, gender, and season. The key findings were expressed as the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for single-day and cumulative lag effects (0-7). A total of 90, 942 RD hospitalization cases were identified during the study period. The highest association (RR, 95% CI) of hospital admissions for RD and PM2.5 (1.030, 1.012-1.049), and PM10 (1.009, 1.001-1.015), and NO2 (1.047, 1.024-1.071) were observed at lag 07 for an increase of 10 μg/m3 in the concentrations, and CO at lag07 (1.140, 1.052-1.236) for an increase of 1 mg/m3 in the concentration. We observed that the RR estimates for gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO and NO2) were larger than those of particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10). The harmful effects of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO were greater in male, people aged 0-14 group and in the cold season. However, no significant association was observed for SO2, O38h, and total hospital admissions for RD. Therefore, some effective intervention strategies should be taken to strengthen the treatment of the ambient air pollutants, especially gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO and NO2), thereby, reducing the burden of respiratory diseases.",

The present study aims to evaluate the association between pediatric emergency department (PED) presentations for bronchiolitis and air pollution. PED presentations due to bronchiolitis in children aged less than 1 year were retrospectively collected from 2007 to 2018 in Padova, Italy, together with daily environmental data. A conditional logistic regression based on a time-stratified case-crossover design was performed to evaluate the association between PED presentations and exposure to NO2 , PM2.5, and PM10. Models were adjusted for temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and public holidays. Delayed effects in time were evaluated using distributed lag non-linear models. Odds ratio for lagged exposure from 0 to 14 days were obtained. Overall, 2251 children presented to the PED for bronchiolitis. Infants' exposure to higher concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in the 5 days before the presentation to the PED increased the risk of accessing the PED by more than 10%, whereas high concentrations of NO2 between 2 and 12 days before the PED presentation were associated with an increased risk of up to 30%. The association between pollutants and infants who required hospitalization was even greater. A cumulative effect of NO2 among the 2 weeks preceding the presentation was also observed. In summary, PM and NO2 concentrations are associated with PED presentations and hospitalizations for bronchiolitis. Exposure of infants to air pollution could damage the respiratory tract mucosa, facilitating viral infections and exacerbating symptoms.",

We surveyed the relationship between AURI hospitalizations and air pollutant concentrations in children aged 0-14 years from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019 in Lanzhou City. METHODS: We collected both data on air pollutant concentrations and children's AURI hospitalizations during the study period. Distributional lagged nonlinear models were adopted to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants on children's AURI hospitalizations. We also performed subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15,881 children were hospitalized for AURI during the study period. The results showed that for each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 , SO2 , and NO2 concentrations at lag0-6, the relative risk (RR) values for children hospitalized for AURI were RR = 1.0247 (95% CI: 1.0092,1.0405), RR = 1.0928 (95% CI: 1.0562, 1.1308), and RR = 1.0715 (95% CI: 1.0495, 1.0940), respectively.

PM2.5 causes similar outcomes but its effect among pulmonary compromised cancer survivors is unknown. This case-crossover study identified the PM2.5-associated odds for primary-respiratory hospitalizations and emergency department visits among childhood cancer survivors in Utah. We compared risk among chemotherapy-treated survivors to a cancer-free sample. We calculated 3-day-average PM2.5 by ZIP code and county for event and control days. Conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios. Models were stratified by cause of admission (infection, respiratory disease, asthma), previous chemotherapy, National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), and other variables. Results are presented per 10 µg/m³ of PM2.5. 90% of events occurred at 3-day PM2.5 averages <35.4 µg/m³, the NAAQS 24-h standard. For survivors, PM2.5 was associated with respiratory hospitalizations (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.13⁻3.00) and hospitalizations from respiratory infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.06⁻4.14).

      "abstract": "RATIONAL: Several studies have found higher risks for childhood respiratory illness, associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM) less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) and PM2.5 and gaseous pollution. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the association between air pollution and hospitalizations due to bronchiolitis, an obstructive pulmonary disorder, commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus infant infection. METHODS: Data were obtained from a local tertiary medical center providing services for a population of 700,000 comprising two ethnic groups: predominantly urban Jews and rural Bedouin Arabs. The latter group includes 30% residing in unrecognized villages in a temporary dwelling. We included all infants (0-2 yr) hospitalized with bronchiolitis between 2003 and 2013. Daily PM estimates were obtained from a satellite-based model incorporating daily remote sensing data and assigned to the family residence locality. Other air pollutants and meteorological parameters were obtained from a local monitoring site. We used case-crossover models with adjustment for temperature. RESULTS: We identified 4,069 bronchiolitis hospitalizations (3,889 children), with 55.3% being Bedouin Arabs, of whom 16.8% resided in temporary dwellings. An increase in interquartile range of average weekly air pollutants was associated with an increased odds of bronchiolitis (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]): PM10 (1.06 [1.02-1.09]), PM2.5 (1.04 [1.02-1.06]) and nitrogen dioxide (1.36 [1.12-1.65]). Higher effect-estimates for PM were observed among Bedouin Arabs residing in temporary dwellings (1.14 [1.01-1.30] and 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) compared with Jewish individuals (1.05 [0.99-1.11] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]) and other Bedouin Arabs (1.05 [1.01-1.10] and 1.03 [1.01-1.07]), and among males (1.11 [1.06-1.16] and 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) compared with females (0.99 [0.94-1.05] and 1.01 [0.97-1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: High PM levels were positively associated with bronchiolitis. The stronger associations among Bedouin Arabs may be related to higher pollution infiltration and exposure in residents of temporary dwellings.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Outdoor particulate and gaseous air pollutants impair respiratory health in children, and these associations may be influenced by particle composition. Objectives: To examine whether associations between short-term variations in fine particulate air pollution, oxidant gases, and respiratory hospitalizations in children are modified by particle constituents (metals and sulfur) or oxidative potential. Methods: We conducted a case-crossover study of 10,500 children (0-17 years of age) across Canada. Daily fine particle mass concentrations and oxidant gases (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) were collected from ground monitors. Monthly estimates of fine particle constituents (metals and sulfur) and oxidative potential were also measured. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between air pollutants and respiratory hospitalizations, above and below median values for particle constituents and oxidative potential. Measurements and Main Results: Lag-1 fine particulate matter mass concentrations were not associated with respiratory hospitalizations (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 μg/m3 increase in fine particulate matter: 1.004 [0.955-1.056]) in analyses ignoring particle constituents and oxidative potential. However, when models were examined above or below median metals, sulfur, and oxidative potential, positive associations were observed above the median. For example, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval per 10 μg/m3 increase in fine particulate matter were 1.084 (1.007-1.167) when copper was above the median and 0.970 (0.929-1.014) when copper was below the median. Similar trends were observed for oxidant gases. Conclusions: Stronger associations were observed between outdoor fine particles, oxidant gases, and respiratory hospitalizations in children when metals, sulfur, and particle oxidative potential were elevated.",

OBJECTIVE: To identify a possible association between exposure to air pollutants and hospitalizations due to SARS-Cov-2. DESIGN AND SETTING: Ecological time-series study carried out in Taubaté, Tremembé, and Pindamonhangaba in 2020 and 2021. METHODS: Study with Sars-Cov-2 hospitalizations with information on hospitalization date, sex and age of the subjects, duration of hospitalization, type of discharge, and costs of these hospitalizations. Statistical analysis was performed through a negative binomial regression, with data on pollutant concentrations, temperature, air relative humidity, and hospitalization date. Coefficients obtained by the analysis were transformed into relative risk for hospitalization, which estimated hospitalizations excess according to an increase in pollutant concentrations. RESULTS: There were 1,300 hospitalizations and 368 deaths, with a predominance of men (61.7%). These data represent an incidence rate of 250.4 per 100,000 inhabitants and 28.4% hospital lethality. Significant exposure (P value < 0.05) occurred seven days before hospital admission (lag 7) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (relative risk, RR = 1.0124) and two days before hospital admission for PM2.5 (RR = 1.0216).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of short-term ambient air pollution exposure and asthma morbidity in the United States have been limited to a small number of cities and/or pollutants and with limited consideration of effects across ages. OBJECTIVES: To estimate acute age group-specific effects of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM), major PM components, and gaseous pollutants on emergency department (ED) visits for asthma during 2005-2014 across the United States. METHODS: We acquired ED visit and air quality data in regions surrounding 53 speciation sites in 10 states. We used quasi-Poisson log-linear time-series models with unconstrained distributed exposure lags to estimate site-specific acute effects of air pollution on asthma ED visits overall and by age group (1-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ y), controlling for meteorology, time trends, and influenza activity. We then used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate pooled associations from site-specific associations. RESULTS: Our analysis included 3.19 million asthma ED visits. We observed positive associations for multiday cumulative exposure to all air pollutants examined [e.g., 8-d exposure to PM2.5: rate ratio of 1.016 with 95% credible interval (CI) of (1.008, 1.025) per 6.3-μg/m3 increase, PM10-2.5: 1.014 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.020) per 9.6-μg/m3 increase, organic carbon: 1.016 (95% CI: 1.009, 1.024) per 2.8-μg/m3 increase, and ozone: 1.008 (95% CI: 0.995, 1.022) per 0.02-ppm increase]. PM2.5 and ozone showed stronger effects at shorter lags, whereas associations of traffic-related pollutants (e.g., elemental carbon and oxides of nitrogen) were generally stronger at longer lags. Most pollutants had more pronounced effects on children (<18 y old) than adults; PM2.5 had strong effects on both children and the elderly (>64 y old); and ozone had stronger effects on adults than children. CONCLUSIONS: We reported positive associations between short-term air pollution exposure and increased rates of asthma ED visits. We found that air pollution exposure posed a higher risk for children and older populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11661.",

      "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important component of natural and human-generated air pollution and a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Short-term effects of PM2.5 exposure on respiratory illness have been described but most evidence arises from high pollution settings. We used case-crossover methods to estimate effects of outdoor PM2.5 levels on emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a range of acute respiratory illnesses and age groups in Melbourne, Australia from 2014-2019, with and without adjustment for other pollutants and weather conditions, using daily and one-week averaged lags. We estimated incidence rate ratios for a 10 μg/m3 increase in 7-day average ambient PM2.5 of 1.043 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.089) on ED presentation and 1.013 (95% CI: 0.971-1.056) on hospital admissions for acute respiratory illnesses for patients of any age. We observed distinct temporal patterns in daily lag effect by disease. The largest effects on acute lower respiratory tract infection and asthma were observed in children. Ambient PM2.5 levels rarely exceeded standards in place at the time. Although uncertainty around most point estimates was relatively wide, these findings are most compatible with adverse health effects of ambient PM2.5 at levels below currently established Australian national standards.Implications: Understanding the health impacts of air pollution is important for setting air quality targets, as well as for informing robust health system planning. Adverse effects of exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter on human respiratory health have been consistently described. However, most studies have been done in higher-pollution settings. Further, many studies have assessed health effects in broad categories such as all-cause respiratory mortality or hospitalization, and thus lack the granularity to inform detailed health service planning. Our study aimed to estimate effects of outdoor fine particulate matter on emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a range of acute respiratory illnesses and age groups in Melbourne, Australia, a city with relatively good air quality by international comparison. Our study estimated consistent effects on both ED presentations and hospital admissions compatible with distinct patterns of adverse health effects at levels at or below established Australian national (and many international) standards. These results will help to inform both air quality policy and public health policy in similar settings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The influences of air pollution exposure and temperature on respiratory diseases have become major global health concerns. This study investigated the relationship between ambient air pollutant concentrations and temperature in cold industrial cities that have the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases. METHODS: A time-series study was conducted in Changchun, China, from 2015 to 2019 to analyse the number of daily admissions for respiratory diseases, air pollutant concentrations, and meteorological factors. Time-series decomposition was applied to analyse the trend and characteristics of the number of admissions. Generalized additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models were constructed to explore the effects of air pollutant concentrations and temperature on the number of admissions. RESULTS: The number of daily admissions showed an increasing trend, and the seasonal fluctuation was obvious, with more daily admissions in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. There were positive and gradually decreasing lag effects of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and CO concentrations on the number of admissions, whereas O3 showed a J-shaped trend. The results showed that within the 7-day lag period, 0.5°C was the temperature associated with the lowest relative risk of admission due to respiratory disease, and extremely low and high temperatures (<-18°C, >27°C, respectively) increased the risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases by 8.3% and 12.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From 2015 to 2019, respiratory diseases in Changchun showed an increasing trend with obvious seasonality. The increased concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5, O3 and PM10 lead to an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases, with a significant lag effect. Both extreme heat and cold could lead to increases in the risk of admission due to respiratory disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prior studies have reported the effects of particulate matter (PM) on respiratory disease (RD) hospitalizations, but few have quantified PM-related economic loss in the central region of China. This investigation aimed to assess the impacts of PM pollution on the risk burden and economic loss of patients admitted with RD. METHODS: Daily cases of RD admitted to the hospital from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 were collected from two class-A tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Time series analysis incorporated with a generalized additive model (GAM) was adopted to assess the impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and inhalable particulate matter (PM10) exposures on patients hospitalized with RD. Stratified analyses were performed to investigate underlying effect modification of RD risk by sex, age, and season. The cost of illness (COI) approach was applied to evaluate the related economic losses caused by PM. RESULTS: A total of 51,676 inpatients with a primary diagnosis of RD were included for the analysis. PM2.5 and PM10 exposures were associated with increased risks of hospitalizations for RD. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that men and children in the 0-14 years age group were more vulnerable to PM, and the adverse effects were promoted by low temperature in the cold season. A 152.4 million China Yuan (CNY) economic loss could be avoided if concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 declined to 10 and 20 μg/m3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were positively associated with RD hospitalization. Men and children were more vulnerable to PM. Effective air pollution control measures can reduce hospitalizations significantly and save economic loss substantially.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfire activity in the United States has increased substantially in recent decades. Smoke fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), a primary wildfire emission, can remain in the air for months after a wildfire begins, yet large-scale evidence of its health effects remains limited. METHODS: We obtained hospitalization records for the residents of 15 states between 2006 and 2016 from the State Inpatient Databases. We used existing daily smoke PM 2.5 estimations at 10-km 2 grid cells across the contiguous United States and aggregated them to ZIP codes to match the spatial resolution of hospitalization records. We extended the traditional case-crossover design, a self-controlled design originally developed for studying acute effects, to examine associations between 3-month average exposure to smoke PM 2.5 and hospitalization risks for a comprehensive range of cardiovascular (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases) and respiratory diseases (acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other respiratory diseases). RESULTS: We found that 3-month exposure to smoke PM 2.5 was associated or marginally associated with increased hospitalization risks for most cardiorespiratory diseases. Hypertension showed the greatest susceptibility, with the highest hospitalization risk associated with 0.1 µg/m 3 increase in 3-month smoke PM 2.5 exposure (relative risk: 1.0051; 95% confidence interval = 1.0035, 1.0067). Results for single-month lagged exposures suggested that estimated effects persisted up to 3 months after exposure. Subgroup analyses estimated larger effects in neighborhoods with higher deprivation level or more vegetation, as well as among ever-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided unique insights into medium-term cardiorespiratory effects of smoke PM 2.5 , which can persist for months, even after a wildfire has ended.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have examined the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in urban cities. The principal aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term impact of PM2.5 on the incidence of URTI in Beijing, China. Data on hospital visits due to URTI from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2012 were obtained from the Beijing Medical Claim Data for Employees, a health insurance database. Daily PM2.5 concentration was acquired from the embassy of the United States of America (US) located in Beijing. A generalized additive Poisson model was used to analyze the effect of PM2.5 on hospital visits for URTI. We found that a 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with 0.84% (95% CI, 0.05⁻1.64%) increase in hospital admissions for URTI at lag 0⁻3 days, but there were no significant associations with emergency room or outpatient visits. Compared to females, males were more likely to be hospitalized for URTI when the PM2.5 level increased, but other findings did not differ by age group or gender. The study suggests that short-term variations in PM2.5 concentrations have small but detectable impacts on hospital utilization due to URTI in adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution poses a major risk for the development and aggravation of respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that even in low-level air pollution environments there is a risk for an increase in adverse respiratory symptoms. We examined whether variations in daily air pollution levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or particulate matter in Berlin, Germany were associated with hospital admissions of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma patients in a time series analysis. METHODS: We calculated single and multi-pollutant models, investigated possible lags in effect, and analysed the influence of meteorological variables on the results. Data from January 2005 through December 2015 were used to quantify the concentration-response. RESULTS: The risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised on the same day of NO2 exposure was 1.101 per 10 µg/m3 NO2 increase (95% CI: 1.013 to 1.195), for COPD patients 1.123 (95% CI: 1.081 to 1.168). Neither the exposure to ozone (95% CI: 0.904 to 1.020), PM10 (95% CI: 0.990 to 1.127), nor PM2.5 (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.148) was associated with an increased risk ratio for asthma patients to be hospitalised. Risk ratios for the hospital admission of COPD patients were also not increased due to ozone (95% CI: 0.981 to 1.033), PM10 (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.032), or PM2.5 (95% CI: 0.966 to 1.019) exposure. The presented risk ratios and confidence intervals relate to the day of exposure. We found no increased hospitalisation risks with a delayed occurrence on subsequent days. CONCLUSIONS: A quantifiable, statistically significant increase in risk for asthma and COPD exacerbations owing to NO2 exposure at levels well below European regulatory limit values was observed.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The escalating intensity of wildfires in the western US is increasing exposure to smoke pollution. Previous studies of wildfire smoke and health have primarily focused on mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular events, with limited research on broader health impacts or on the shape of concentration-response curves. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the associations between exposure to smoke-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cause-specific hospitalizations among older adults in the western US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare inpatient claims data from 2006 to 2016 linked with machine learning-derived smoke-specific PM2.5 to assess associations between smoke PM2.5 and hospitalization rates. Participants included Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older who lived in a western US state (ie, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, or Wyoming). Analyses were conducted from October 2023 to February 2025. EXPOSURES: Daily county-level smoke-specific PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from machine learning models trained on monitor and satellite data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily county-level rates of unscheduled hospitalization for each of 13 broad cause categories. To characterize the association between each cause of hospitalization and smoke PM2.5, distributed lag models were fitted with hospitalization rates modeled as a function of same-day smoke PM2.5 exposure and exposures on each day of the preceding week, using splines on exposure to allow for nonlinearity. RESULTS: The study included 10 369 361 individuals (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.9] years; 4 862 826 male [46.9%]; 5 506 535 female [53.1%]; 373 252 Black [3.6%]; 420 577 Hispanic [4.1%]; and 8 365 607 White [80.7%]), 57 million person-months of follow-up, and 4.7 million unscheduled hospitalizations. Smoke PM2.5 concentration-response curves for respiratory hospitalizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations were flat at lower concentrations but showed increasing trends at concentrations above 25 μg/m3. On average, daily hospitalizations (per 100 000) increased by 2.40 (95% CI, 0.17 to 4.63) for respiratory concerns when increasing same-day and preceding week smoke PM2.5 concentrations from 0 to 40 μg/m3; hospitalizations for cardiovascular concerns increased by 2.61 (95% CI, -0.09 to 5.30), a difference that was not statistically significant. No associations were observed for other causes of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, exposure to high levels of smoke pollution was associated with an increase in hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. These findings underscore the need for interventions to mitigate the health impacts of wildfire smoke exposure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wildfire smoke is known to exacerbate respiratory conditions; however, evidence for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events has been inconsistent, despite biological plausibility. METHODS AND RESULTS: A population-based epidemiologic analysis was conducted for daily cardiovascular and cerebrovascular emergency department (ED) visits and wildfire smoke exposure in 2015 among adults in 8 California air basins. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used for zip code-level counts of ED visits, adjusting for heat index, day of week, seasonality, and population. Satellite-imaged smoke plumes were classified as light, medium, or dense based on model-estimated concentrations of fine particulate matter. Relative risk was determined for smoky days for lag days 0 to 4. Rates of ED visits by age- and sex-stratified groups were also examined. Rates of all-cause cardiovascular ED visits were elevated across all lags, with the greatest increase on dense smoke days and among those aged ≥65 years at lag 0 (relative risk 1.15, 95% confidence interval [1.09, 1.22]). All-cause cerebrovascular visits were associated with smoke, especially among those 65 years and older, (1.22 [1.00, 1.49], dense smoke, lag 1). Respiratory conditions were also increased, as anticipated (1.18 [1.08, 1.28], adults >65 years, dense smoke, lag 1). No association was found for the control condition, acute appendicitis. Elevated risks for individual diagnoses included myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, dysrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of an extensive wildfire season found smoke exposure to be associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ED visits for all adults, particularly for those over aged 65 years.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several studies suggest that air pollution, particularly PM2.5, increases morbidity and mortality, Emergency Department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations for acute respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, no prior study in Southeastern Asia (SEA) has examined the effects of air pollutants on ED visits and health outcomes. This study focused on the association of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of PM2.5 and other pollutants' effects on ED visits, hospitalization, and unexpected deaths due to acute respiratory disease, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute heart failure (AHF), and stroke. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study with daily data from ED visits between 2018 and 2019 at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand. The AQI of air pollution data was collected from outdoor air quality from the Smoke Haze Integrated Research Unit and the Air Quality Index Visual Map. A distributed lag, non-linear and quasi-Poisson models were used to explore the relationship between air quality parameters and ED visits for each disease. RESULTS: 3,540 ED visits were recorded during the study period. The mean daily AQI of PM2.5 was 89.0 ± 40.2. We observed associations between AQI of PM2.5 and the ED visits due to ACS on the following day (RR = 1.023, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002-1.044) and two days after exposure (RR = 1.026, 95% CI: 1.005-1.047). Also, subgroup analysis revealed the association between AQI of PM2.5 and the ED visits due to pneumonia on the current day (RR = 1.071, 95% CI: 1.025-1.118) and on the following day after exposure (RR = 1.024, 95% CI: 1.003-1.046). AQI of PM2.5 associated with increased mortality resulted from ACS on lag day 3 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.73). The AQI of PM10 is also associated with increased ED visits due to COPD/asthma and increased hospitalization in AHF. In addition, the AQI of O3 and AQI of NO2 is associated with increased ICU admissions and mortality in AHF. CONCLUSION: Short-term PM2.5 exposure escalates ED visits for ACS and pneumonia. PM10's AQI associates with COPD/asthma ED visits and AHF hospitalizations. AQI of O3 and NO2's link to increased ICU admissions and AHF mortality. Urgent action against air pollution is vital to safeguard public health.",

From January 2015 to October 2017, a prospective cohort involving 433,032 participants across 3 counties in Qingdao were enrolled in the study. Distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the associations between air pollutants and pneumonia hospitalizations.

Subgroup analyses indicate that PM ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter and SO2 showed stronger effects on pneumonia in females than males, whereas people in urban regions were more vulnerable to nitrogen dioxide and ozone (O3) than the others. We also observed distinct acute effects and harvesting effects of SO2 and O3 on pneumonia in urban areas. Strategies should be taken to further reduce levels of ambient PM2.5, SO2, and O3.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have reported associations of short-term exposure to different sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased mortality or hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. Few studies, however, have focused on the short-term effects of source-specific PM2.5 on emergency room visits (ERVs) of respiratory diseases. Source apportionment for PM2.5 was performed with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and generalized additive model was applied to estimate associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease ERVs. The association of PM2.5 and total respiratory ERVs was found on lag4 (RR = 1.011, 95%CI: 1.002, 1.020) per interquartile range (76 μg/m3) increase. We found PM2.5 to be significantly associated with asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ERVs, with the strongest effects on lag5 (RR = 1.072, 95%CI: 1.024, 1.119), lag4 (RR = 1.104, 95%CI: 1.032, 1.176) and lag3 (RR = 1.091, 95%CI: 1.047, 1.135), respectively. The estimated effects of PM2.5 changed little after adjusting for different air pollutants. Six primary PM2.5 sources were identified using PMF analysis, including dust/soil (6.7%), industry emission (4.5%), secondary aerosols (30.3%), metal processing (3.2%), coal combustion (37.5%) and traffic-related source (17.8%). Some of the sources were identified to have effects on ERVs of total respiratory diseases (dust/soil, secondary aerosols, metal processing, coal combustion and traffic-related source), bronchitis ERVs (dust/soil) and COPD ERVs (traffic-related source, industry emission and secondary aerosols). Different sources of PM2.5 contribute to increased risk of respiratory ERVs to different extents, which may provide potential implications for the decision making of air quality related policies, rational emission control and public health welfare.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution poses a threat to children's respiratory health. This study aims to quantify the association between short-term air pollution exposure and respiratory hospital admissions among children in Hanoi, Vietnam, and estimate the population-attributable burden using local data. A case-crossover analysis was conducted based on the individual records where each case is their own control. The health data was obtained from 13 hospitals in Hanoi and air pollution data was collected from four monitoring stations from 2007 to 2019. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate Percentage Change (PC) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in odd of hospital admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in daily average particulate matter (e.g. PM1, PM2.5, PM10), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), 8-h maximum Ozone and per 1000 μg/m3 increase in daily mean of Carbon Monoxide (CO). We also calculated the number and fraction of admissions attributed to air pollution in Hanoi by using the coefficient at lag 0. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the concentration of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, SO2, NO2, O3 8-h maximum and 1000 μg/m3 increase in CO concentration was associated with 0.6%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 0.8%, 1.6%, 0.3%, and 1.7% increase in odd of admission for all respiratory diseases among children under 16 years at lag 0-2. All PM metrics and NO2 are associated with childhood admission for pneumonia and bronchitis. Admissions due to asthma and upper respiratory diseases are related to increments in NO2 and CO. For attributable cases, PM2.5 concentrations in Hanoi exceeding the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines accounted for 1619 respiratory hospital admissions in Hanoi children in 2019. Our findings show that air pollution has a detrimental impact on the respiratory health of Hanoi children and there will be important health benefits from improved air quality management planning to reduce air pollution in Vietnam.",

Our research aimed to explore whether there is a correlation and to estimate how the association was distributed across various lags in Jinan, China.The relationships between ambient air pollutant concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and monthly hospitalizations for RA-ILD were studied by employing a general linear model with a Poisson distribution. This time-series study was performed from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2019.In the 5-year study, there were 221 hospitalizations for RA-ILD in Jinan city. The levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were significantly related to the number of admissions for RA-ILD. PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 showed the most significant effect on the month (lag 0), and NO2 was most related to RA-ILD at a lag of two months (lag 2). The monthly admissions of RA-ILD increased by 0.875% (95% CI: 0.375-1.377%), 0.548% (95% CI: 0.148-0.949%), 1.968% (95% CI: 0.869-3.080%), and 1.534% (95% CI: 0.305-2.778%) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2, respectively.This study might add more detailed evidence that higher levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increase the risk of hospitalizations for RA-ILD. Further study of the role of air pollution in the pathogenesis of RA-ILD is warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Associations between pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and ambient concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) have been reported in previous studies, although few were performed in nonmetropolitan areas. OBJECTIVE: We estimated associations between daily PM2.5 concentrations, using a two-stage model that included land use parameters and satellite aerosol optical depth measurements at 1-km resolution, and ED visits for six pediatric conditions in the U.S. state of Georgia by urbanicity classification. METHODS: We obtained pediatric ED visits geocoded to residential ZIP codes for visits with nonmissing PM2.5 estimates and admission dates during 1 January 2002-30 June 2010 for 2- to 18-year-olds for asthma or wheeze (n = 189,816), and for 0- to 18-year-olds for bronchitis (n = 76,243), chronic sinusitis (n = 15,745), otitis media (n = 237,833), pneumonia (n = 52,946), and upper respiratory infections (n = 414,556). Daily ZIP code-level estimates of 24-hr average PM2.5 were calculated by averaging concentrations within ZIP code boundaries. We used time-stratified case-crossover models stratified on ZIP code, year, and month to estimate odds ratios (ORs) between ED visits and same-day and previous-day PM2.5 concentrations at the ZIP code level, and we investigated effect modification by county-level urbanicity. RESULTS: A 10-μg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5 concentrations was associated with ED visits for asthma or wheeze (OR = 1.013; 95% CI: 1.003, 1.023) and upper respiratory infections (OR = 1.015; 95% CI: 1.008, 1.022); associations with previous-day PM2.5 concentrations were lower. Differences in the association estimates across levels of urbanicity were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED visits for asthma or wheeze and for upper respiratory infections were associated with PM2.5 concentrations in Georgia.

      "abstract": "Prior studies reported excess rates (ERs) of cardiorespiratory events associated with short-term increases in PM2.5 concentrations, despite implementation of pollution-control policies. In 2017, Federal Tier 3 light-duty vehicle regulations began, and to-date there have been no assessments of population health effects of the policy. Using the NYS Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database, we obtained hospitalizations and ED visits with a principal diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for residents living within 15 miles of six urban PM2.5 monitoring sites in NYS (2014-2019). We used a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression (adjusting for ambient temperature, relative humidity, and weekday) to estimate associations between PM2.5, POC (primary organic carbon), SOC (secondary organic carbon), and rates of respiratory disease hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits from 2014 to 2019. We evaluated demographic disparities in these relative rates and compared changes in ERs before (2014-2016) and after Tier 3 implementation (2017-2019). Each interquartile range increase in PM2.5 was associated with increased ERs of asthma or COPD hospitalizations and ED visits in the previous 7 days (ERs ranged from 1.1%-3.1%). Interquartile range increases in POC were associated with increased rates of asthma ED visits (lag days 0-6: ER = 2.1%, 95% CI = 0.7%, 3.6%). Unexpectedly, the ERs of asthma admission and ED visits associated with PM2.5, POC, and SOC were higher during 2017-2019 (after Tier 3) than 2014-2016 (before Tier-3). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease analyses showed similar patterns. Excess Rates were higher in children (<18 years; asthma) and seniors (≥65 years; COPD), and Black, Hispanic, and NYC residents. In summary, unanticipated increases in asthma and COPD ERs after Tier-3 implementation were observed, and demographic disparities in asthma/COPD and PM2.5, POC, and SOC associations were also observed. Future work should confirm findings and investigate triggering of respiratory events by source-specific PM.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Abundant evidence has shown that an increase in the concentration of fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) leads to a simultaneous increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases. Xigu District is the main industrial district of Lanzhou, located in Lanzhou City in northwest China and central Gansu Province. Because of limited research and data in the region, the impact of PM2.5 on human health has not been systematically recognized. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 pollution and upper respiratory tract infections in urban industrial areas of Lanzhou City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on outpatient visits, air pollutants, and meteorological indices were collected in the Xigu District of Lanzhou City from 1 January 2013 - 31 December 2019. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate the association between PM2.5 and outpatient visits for upper respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: The results show that PM2.5 had the greatest impact on outpatient visits for upper respiratory tract infections on 7 cumulative lag days. At cumulative lag days 1, 3, and 5, the effects gradually increased. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of PM2.5 on visits for upper respiratory tract infections was significantly influenced by gender. Men were more susceptible to PM2.5 pollution. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in atmospheric PM2.5 concentration was associated with an increase in visits for upper respiratory tract infections with the lag effect. The obtained results can provide a reference for the development of prevention strategies to protect the population from the adverse effects of PM2.5 pollution.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent increases in wildfire frequency and severity necessitate better understanding of health effects of wildfire smoke to protect affected populations. OBJECTIVES: We examined relationships between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and morbidity during wildfires in California, and whether those relationships differed during the fire compared to a similar non-fire period. METHODS: For nine San Francisco Bay Area counties, daily county-level diagnosis-specific counts of emergency department visits (EDVs) and hospitalizations were linked with county-level estimates of daily mean PM2.5 during the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and similar October days in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Associations were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The median difference between county PM2.5 during the fire versus the non-fire period was 23.4 μg/m3, with days exceeding 80 μg/m3 in some counties. Over the entire study period, PM2.5 was most consistently linked to EDVs for respiratory disease (RREDV(lag0) per 23.4 μg/m3 increase: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.30), asthma, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD; RREDV(lag0): 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.27), and acute myocardial infarction (RREDV(lag0): 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.25). Increases in acute upper respiratory infections and decreases in mental/behavioral EDVs were observed but were sensitive to model specification, specifically the inclusion of time-related covariates. Comparing fire and non-fire period EDV associations, we observed indications that PM2.5 during the fire was more strongly associated with asthma (RRlag0: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.55) compared to non-fire period PM2.5 (RRlag0: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.08), and the opposite observed for dysrhythmia, with the asthma difference being particularly robust to model choice. For hospitalizations, the most robust PM2.5 relationships were positive associations with respiratory, CLRD, and diabetes, and inverse associations with pneumonia. Respiratory and CLRD effect estimates were generally similar or smaller than for EDVs. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated short-term PM2.5 levels from wildfire smoke appears to impact respiratory and other health domains.",

We categorized the daily mean temperature and air pollutant variables based on the exposure-response curve of the Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model. Poisson regression model was used for interaction and stratification analysis. The Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between daily mean temperature (Tmean) and air pollutants including NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 were - 0.428 (95% CI - 0.637, - 0.218), -- 0.227 (95% CI - 0.293, - 0.161), and - 0.119 (95% CI - 0.159, - 0.079). Further stratification analysis showed the relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of high NO2 (> 33 μg/m3) at low Tmean (≤ 28 °C) was 1.119 (95% CI 1.096, 1.142). Low temperatures with high PM10 in men and high PM2.5 in women were associated with a higher risk of AECOPD hospitalization.

      "abstract": "Dust is a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in arid regions; therefore, concentrations of this pollutant in countries such as Kuwait exceed air quality standards. There is limited understanding on the impact and burden of high PM2.5 concentrations on morbidity in these countries. In this study, we explore the association of PM2.5 and the risk of respiratory hospital admissions in Kuwait. A time-series regression model was used to investigate daily variations in respiratory admissions and PM2.5 concentrations from 2010 to 2018. Due to the lack of historical air quality sampling in Kuwait, we used estimated daily PM2.5 levels from a hybrid PM2.5 prediction model. Individual and cumulative lag effects of PM2.5 over a 5-day period were estimated using distributed lag linear models. Associations were stratified by sex, age, and nationality. There were 218,749 total respiratory admissions in Kuwait during the study period. Results indicate that for every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, a 1.61% (95% CI = 0.87, 2.35%) increase in respiratory admissions followed over a 5-day cumulative lag. Our estimates show that a 10 μg/m3 reduction in average exposure will potentially avert 391 yearly respiratory admissions (95% CI = 211,571), with 265 fewer admissions among Kuwaitis (95% CI = 139,393) and 262 fewer admissions among children under 15 years of age (95% CI = 125,351). Different strata of the Kuwaiti population are vulnerable to respiratory hospitalization with short-term exposure to PM2.5, especially those under 15 years of age.

Using source-specific PM2.5 concentrations at six urban sites in New York State, a case-crossover design, and conditional logistic regression, we examined the association between source-specific PM and the rate of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for influenza or culture-negative pneumonia from 2005 to 2016.

We separately estimated the rate of respiratory infection associated with increased concentrations of source-specific PM2.5, including secondary sulfate (SS), secondary nitrate (SN), biomass burning (BB), pyrolyzed organic carbon (OP), road dust (RD), residual oil (RO), diesel (DIE), and spark ignition vehicle emissions (GAS). Increased rates of ED visits for influenza were associated with interquartile range increases in concentrations of GAS (excess rate [ER] = 9.2%; 95% CI: 4.3%, 14.3%) and DIE (ER = 3.9%; 95% CI: 1.1%, 6.8%) for lag days 0-3. There were similar associations between BB, SS, OP, and RO, and ED visits or hospitalizations for influenza, but not culture-negative pneumonia hospitalizations or ED visits.

      "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the associations between air pollution and emergency hospital visits for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in the arid regions of northwest China. We collected daily emergency department (ED) visits for URTI from three hospitals in Lanzhou during January 2014 and December 2018, as well as daily air pollutants and meteorological factors. In the present study, generalized additive model with quasi-Poisson regression was used to evaluate the relationship between short-term exposure to ambient pollutants and daily emergency hospital visits for URTI in Lanzhou, China. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted by gender (male and female), age (0-14, 15-64, and ≥ 65 years)), and season (cold season, warm season). The results of the single-pollutant model show that the associations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO with URTI ED visits were all statistically significant, whereas we observed insignificant associations of O38h. The highest association of each pollutant with hospital emergency visits was observed with PM2.5 (5.302% (95% CI: 3.202, 7.445)), PM10 (0.808% (95% CI: 0.291, 1.328)), SO2 (10.607% (95% CI: 5.819, 15.611)), and NO2 (5.325% (95% CI: 2.379, 8.357)) at lag 07 for an increase of 10 ug/m3 in concentrations of the pollutants. Percentage increase for each 1-mg/m3 increase in CO was 20.799% (95% CI: 11.834, 30.482) at lag 07. In the stratification analyses, females were more susceptible to PM2.5 and PM10, while males were more sensitive to the effects of SO2, NO2, and CO, and the higher association effect of four pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO) on hospital visits for URTI among children (0-14 years). The associations appeared to be stronger in the cool season than in the warm season. This study suggests that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to SO2 and CO, was associated with increased risk of hospital emergency visits for URTI in Lanzhou, China. Relevant strategies and health interventions should be strengthened to reduce the air pollution level in the future.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with an increased incidence of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and asthma, especially in younger children. We investigated the relationship between rates of hospitalization of children aged under 5 years for pneumonia and asthma and the concentration of air pollutants in Ningbo between January 1, 2015 and August 29, 2017. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Ningbo Air Quality Data Real-time Publishing System and the big data platform of the Ningbo Health Information Center. A generalized additive model was established via logarithmic link function and utilized to evaluate the effect of pollutant concentration on lag dimension and perform sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 10,301 cases of pneumonia and 115 cases of asthma were identified over the course of this study. Results revealed that PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were significantly associated with hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma in children under 5 years of age. For every 10-unit increase in lag03 air pollutant concentration, hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma due to PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increased by 2.22% (95%CI: 0.64%, 3.82%), 1.94% (95%CI: 0.85%, 3.04%), 11.21% (95%CI: 4.70%, 18.10%) and 5.42% (95%CI: 3.07%, 7.82%), respectively. DISCUSSION: Adverse effects of air pollutants were found to be more severe in children aged 1 to 5 years and adverse effects due to PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 were found to be more severe in girls. Our findings underscore the need for implementation of effective public health measures to urgently improve air quality and reduce pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory illness.",

Daily patient-level records were obtained from the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) Asthma Surveillance System. Patient geolocations were aggregated into a grid with 0.1° × 0.1° resolution within the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area. Daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated via machine-learning algorithms with remotely sensed aerosol optical depth and other associated parameters as inputs. Controlling for long-term temporal trends and meteorology, we estimated a 7.2% (95% confidence interval 1.7-13.1%) increase in daily all-age asthma emergency room admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in the 3-day average of PM2.5 levels (current day and two prior days). Stratified analyses reveal significant associations between asthma and 3-day average PM2.5 for males and blacks. Our results contribute to the current epidemiologic evidence on the association between acute ambient air pollution exposure and asthma morbidity, even in an area characterized by relatively good air quality.",

      "abstract": "Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) lead to increased morbidity and premature deaths, imposing a significant burden on public health worldwide. Recently, several studies have linked ambient air pollution with the acute exacerbation of certain ILDs, but the evidence remains limited and inconclusive. With a multicenter hospital-based case-crossover design, we investigated 9128 patients who resided in Jiangsu province, China, and were admitted for ILDs between 2019 and 2022. Residential exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5), PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) was assessed using our validated grid datasets. We fitted conditional logistic regression models to examine associations of exposure to air pollutants with ILD admission. A 10 µg/m3 increment of exposure to SO2 and NO2 was positively associated with a 16.18 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3.79 %, 30.03 %) and 4.06 % (0.75 %, 7.49 %) increase in odds of ILD admission, respectively. All these associations appeared to be linear and the association of SO2 exposure was significantly stronger among older adults. We estimated that over 10 % of ILD admissions could be attributable to exposure to SO2 and NO2. This study provides compelling evidence on the association of exposure to ambient air pollutants (including SO2 and NO2) with an increased odds of ILD hospitalizations. Our findings indicate that SO2 and NO2 exposures can lead to the exacerbation of ILDs, especially in elderly, and that the disease burden is considerable.",

METHODS: Time series study analysing emergency hospital admissions in the MAR due to all causes (ICD-10: A00-R99), respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) and circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) across the period 2013-2018. The main independent variables were mean daily PM2.5, PM10, NO2, 8-h ozone concentrations, and noise. We controlled for meteorological variables, Public Holidays, seasonality, and the trend and autoregressive nature of the series, and fitted generalised linear models with a Poisson regression link to ascertain the relative risks and attributable risks. In addition, we made an economic assessment of these hospitalisations. RESULTS: The following associations were found: NO2 with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.007, 95% CI: 1.004-1.011) and respiratory causes (RR: 1.012, 95% CI: 1.005-1.019); 8-h ozone with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.049, 95% CI: 1.014-1.046) and circulatory causes (RR: 1.088, 95% CI: 1.039-1.140); and diurnal noise (LAeq7-23h) with admissions due to natural (RR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001-1.002), respiratory (RR: 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001-1.003) and circulatory causes (RR: 1.003, 95% CI: 1.002-1.005). Every year, a total of 8246 (95% CI: 4580-11,905) natural-cause admissions are attributable to NO2, with an estimated cost of close on €120 million and 5685 (95% CI: 2533-8835) attributed to LAeq7-23h with an estimated cost of close on €82 million. CONCLUSIONS: Nitrogen dioxide, ozone and noise are the main pollutants to which a large number of hospitalisations in the MAR are attributed, and are thus responsible for a marked deterioration in population health and high related economic impact.",

There is limited evidence on the acute effects of air pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: From 2014 to 2019, we collected data on daily admissions for COPD patients from a city in China. We used the generalized additive model together with distributed lag models to fit the associations of air pollutants with hospital admissions. RESULTS: We observed significant increments in the number of daily admissions (0.086-0.109%) for COPD for a unit range increase in air quality index, PM2.5 and PM10 over four lag days. The impact of air pollution on the number of daily admissions was mainly reflected in the COPD patients who were hospitalized through outpatient departments and tertiary hospitals. DISCUSSION: Short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution may induce the occurrence or exacerbation of COPD patients; therefore, government departments should strengthen the management of air pollution, improve supervision and control mechanisms, pay attention to the quality of medical services, and reduce the adverse effects of air pollution on patients' health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The associations between fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) air pollution and hospital admissions for full-spectrum respiratory diseases were rarely investigated, especially for age-specific associations. We aim to estimate the age-specific associations of short-term exposures to PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 with hospital admissions for full-spectrum respiratory diseases in China. METHODS: We conducted an individual-level case-crossover study based on a nationwide hospital-based registry including 153 hospitals across 20 provincial regions in China in 2013-20. We applied conditional logistic regression models and distributed lag models to estimate the exposure- and lag-response associations. RESULTS: A total of 1 399 955 hospital admission records for various respiratory diseases were identified. The associations of PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 with total respiratory hospitalizations lasted for 4 days, and an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 (34.5 μg/m3) and PM2.5-10 (26.0 μg/m3) was associated with 1.73% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.34%, 2.12%)] and 1.70% (95% CI: 1.31%, 2.10%) increases, respectively, in total respiratory hospitalizations over lag 0-4 days. Acute respiratory infections (i.e. pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis) were consistently associated with PM2.5 or PM2.5-10 exposure across different age groups. We found the disease spectrum varied by age, including rarely reported findings (i.e. acute laryngitis and tracheitis, and influenza) among children and well-established associations (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute bronchitis and emphysema) among older populations. Besides, the associations were stronger in females, children and older populations. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide case-crossover study provides robust evidence that short-term exposure to both PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 was associated with increased hospital admissions for a wide range of respiratory diseases, and the spectra of respiratory diseases varied by age. Females, children and older populations were more susceptible.",

The objective here was to estimate the effect of exposure to particulate matter (such as PM2.5) on hospitalizations due to certain respiratory diseases among residents in Volta Redonda (RJ). DESIGN AND SETTING: Ecological time series study using data from Volta Redonda (RJ). METHODS: Data on hospital admissions among residents of Volta Redonda (RJ), between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, due to pneumonia, acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma, were analyzed. Daily data on PM2.5 concentrations were estimated through the CCATT-BRAMS model. The generalized additive Poisson regression model was used, taking the daily number of hospitalizations to be the dependent variable and the PM2.5 concentration to be the independent variable, with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity, seasonality and day of the week, and using lags of zero to seven days. Excess hospitalization and its cost were calculated in accordance with increases in PM2.5 concentration of 5 µg/m3. RESULTS: There were 752 hospitalizations in 2012; the average concentration of PM2.5 was 17.2 µg/m3; the effects of exposure were significant at lag 2 (RR = 1.017), lag 5 (RR = 1.022) and lag 7 (RR = 1,020). A decrease in PM2.5 concentration of 5 µg/m3 could reduce admissions by up to 76 cases, with a decrease in spending of R$ 84,000 a year. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study provide support for implementing public health policies in this municipality, which is an important steelmaking center. CONTEXTO E OBJETIVO:: A exposição aos poluentes do ar é um dos fatores responsáveis por internações por doenças respiratórias; o objetivo foi estimar o efeito da exposição a material particulado (como PM2,5) sobre as hospitalizações devido a certas doenças respiratórias em moradores de Volta Redonda (RJ). TIPO DE ESTUDO E LOCAL:: Estudo ecológico de séries temporais utilizando dados de Volta Redonda (RJ). MÉTODOS:: Foram analisados dados de internação hospitalar, entre 1 de janeiro de 2012 e 31 de dezembro de 2012, devida a pneumonia, bronquite aguda, bronquiolite e asma, em residentes em Volta Redonda (RJ), e dados diários das concentrações de PM2,5 obtidos a partir do modelo CCATT-BRAMS. Utilizou-se o modelo aditivo generalizado de regressão de Poisson, sendo o número diário de internações a variável dependente e a concentração PM2,5 a variável independente, ajustado para temperatura, umidade relativa, sazonalidade e dia da semana e defasagens entre zero e sete dias. Excesso de internação hospitalar e seu custo, de acordo com o aumento de 5 ug/m3 na concentração de PM2,5, foram calculados. RESULTADOS:: Ocorreram 752 internações em 2012; a concentração média de PM2,5 foi de 17,2 ug/m3; os efeitos da exposição foram significativos em lag 2 (RR = 1,017), lag 5 (RR = 1,022) e lag 7 (RR = 1,020). A redução em 5 ug/m3 na concentração de PM2,5 poderia reduzir até 76 casos as internações com diminuição nos gastos de R$ 84 mil/ano.

RESULTS: With PM2.5 levels of 20.0 μg/m3 as a reference, PM2.5 levels of 30.0 μg/m3 were positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (relative risk (RR) = 1.048, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.028, 1.069) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.060, 95% CI: 1.038, 1.082) but not with the risk of acute lower respiratory infection and pneumonia. PM2.5 levels of 40.0 μg/m3 were also positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (RR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.046, 1.122) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.094, 95% CI: 1.054, 1.136). CONCLUSIONS: We found the associations of short-term PM2.5 exposure with acute upper respiratory infection and bronchitis or bronchiolitis among children aged 0-4 years. As causal inference methods can provide more convincing evidence of the effects of PM2.5 levels on respiratory infections, public health policies and guidelines regarding PM2.5 need to be strengthened accordingly.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that ambient air pollution is a major risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations and emergencies. The objective of this study was to determine the association between ambient air pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory conditions in nine districts across the province of Ontario in Canada. Health, air pollutant (PM2.5, NO2, O3, and SO2), and meteorological data were retrieved from April 2004 to December 2011. Respiratory diseases were categorized as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchiectasis) and acute upper respiratory diseases. A case-crossover design was used to test the associations between ED visits and ambient air pollutants, stratified by sex and season. For COPD among males, positive results were observed for NO2 with lags of 3-6 days, for PM2.5 with lags 1-8, and for SO2 with lags of 4-8 days. For COPD among females, positive results were observed for O3 with lags 2-4 days, and for SO2 among lags of 3-6 days. For upper respiratory disease emergencies among males, positive results were observed for NO2 (lags 5-8 days), for O3, (lags 0-6 days), PM2.5 (all lags), and SO2 (lag 8), and among females, positive results were observed for NO2 for lag 8 days, for O3, PM2.5 among all lags. Our study provides evidence of the associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and increased risk of ED visits for upper and lower respiratory diseases in an environment where air pollutant concentrations are relatively low.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid economic development and acceleration of industrialization, most cities in China are experiencing severe air pollution. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). To estimate associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and ALRI hospitalization in Yancheng City, China. This was a 6-year time-series study from 2014 to 2019. Data on hospitalization were collected from four high-ranked general hospitals, including for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis (AEB), and the sum was termed total ALRIs. We obtained pollutant exposure data from five fixed monitoring stations. The association between PM2.5 and ALRI hospitalization was estimated using the generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson regression. Two-pollutant models were applied to test the robustness of the observed correlations. Subgroup analyses included sex, age, and season. During the study period, a total of 43,283 cases of total ALRIs were recorded. The average annual mean PM2.5 concentration was 45.4 ± 32.3 μg/m3. A 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration (lag 0) was significantly associated with increases in hospitalizations for total ALRIs (at 0.73%; 95% CI: 0.40%, 1.06%), in CAP (at 0.80%; 95% CI: 0.02%, 1.57%), in for AECOPD (1.08%; 95% CI: 0.38%, 1.78%), and AECB (0.67%; 95% CI: 0.23%, 1.11%). The estimated effects for total ALRIs and AECB were relatively robust with adjustment for other air pollutants. Associations between PM2.5 and total ALRIs were stronger in females, in the elderly, and in the cold season. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with ALRI morbidity, and females and older people were more susceptible to PM2.5 air pollution, especially in the cold season.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The impacts of air pollution on circulatory and respiratory systems have been extensively studied. However, the associations between air pollution exposure and the risk of noncommunicable diseases of other organ systems, including diseases of the digestive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary systems, remain unclear or inconclusive. We aimed to systematically assess the associations between short-term exposure to main air pollutants (fine particulate matter [PM2.5] and ozone) and cause-specific risk of hospital admission in China over a wide spectrum of human diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Daily data on hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of 14 major and 188 minor disease categories in 252 Chinese cities (107 cities in North China and 145 cities in South China) from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017, were obtained from the Hospital Quality Monitoring System of China (covering 387 hospitals in North China and 614 hospitals in South China). We applied a 2-stage analytic approach to assess the associations between air pollution and daily hospital admissions. City-specific associations were estimated with quasi-Poisson regression models and then pooled by random-effects meta-analyses. Each disease category was analyzed separately, and the P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. A total of 117,338,867 hospital admissions were recorded in the study period. Overall, 51.7% of the hospitalized cases were male, and 71.3% were aged <65 years. Robust positive associations were found between short-term PM2.5 exposure and hospital admissions for 7 major disease categories: (1) endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases; (2) nervous diseases; (3) circulatory diseases; (4) respiratory diseases; (5) digestive diseases; (6) musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases; and (7) genitourinary diseases. For example, a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.21% (95% CI 0.15% to 0.27%; adjusted P < 0.001) increase in hospital admissions for diseases of the digestive system on the same day in 2-pollutant models (adjusting for ozone). There were 35 minor disease categories significantly positively associated with same-day PM2.5 in both single- and 2-pollutant models, including diabetes mellitus, anemia, intestinal infection, liver diseases, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal failure, urinary tract calculus, chronic ulcer of skin, and back problems. The association between short-term ozone exposure and respiratory diseases was robust. No safety threshold in the exposure-response relationships between PM2.5 and hospital admissions was observed. The main limitations of the present study included the unavailability of data on personal air pollution exposures. CONCLUSIONS: In the Chinese population during 2013-2017, short-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM2.5, was associated with increased risk of hospitalization for diseases of multiple organ systems, including certain diseases of the digestive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary systems; many of these associations are important but still not fully recognized. The effect estimates and exposure-response relationships can inform policy making aimed at protecting public health from air pollution in China.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested the effects of ambient fine particles (PM2.5) on asthma, but the effects of specific components of PM2.5 on asthma remain to be explored. Here, we studied the effect of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on asthma acute exacerbation. The data on daily counts of emergency room visits (ERVs) were obtained from Wan Fang Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, from 2012 to 2015. The daily concentrations of PM2.5 and pollutant gases were obtained from a local air quality monitoring station. The levels of PM2.5-bound PAH were estimated by an established grid-scale model. Relative risks for ERVs as the increase in the level of ambient pollutants were calculated by using a generalized additive model of Poisson regression. In the present study, we observed statistically significant positive associations between PM2.5 and asthma ERVs for all age groups. PM2.5-bound PAH was also associated with asthma ERVs for all age groups. In the adult subgroup analysis, there was a significant association between PM2.5-bound PAH and asthma ERVs at lags 1 and 2 (RR 1.289, 95% CI 1.050-1.582 and RR 1.242, 95% CI 1.039-1.485). The impacts of air pollution on the risk of pediatric asthma ERV were found to be significant for PM2.5 at lag day 0 (RR 1.310, 95% CI 1.069-1.606). Moreover, pediatric asthma ERVs were significantly associated with the levels of PM2.5-bound PAH at lag 1 and 2 days (RR 1.576, 95% CI 1.371-1.810 and RR 1.426, 95% CI 1.265-1.607). The study provides evidence that PM2.5-bound PAHs were associated with an increased risk of asthma attacks. Our data further suggested that traffic exhaust is a primary source of PM2.5-bound PAHs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies on the association between short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) with hospital admission in major cities in China were limited to shorter study periods or a single hospital. The aim of this ecological study based on a 12.5-year time series was to investigate the association of short-term exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases. METHODS: Daily hospital admissions data were from the Shanghai Medical Insurance System for the period January 1, 2008 to July 31, 2020. We estimated the percentage change with its 95% confidence interval (CI) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in the level of PM2.5 and PM10 after adjustment for calendar time, day of the week, public holidays, and meteorological factors applying a generalized additive model with a quasi-Poisson distribution. RESULTS: There were 1,960,361 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Shanghai during the study period. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the level of each class of PM was associated with increased total respiratory diseases when the lag time was 0 day (PM2.5: 0.755%; 95% CI: 0.422, 1.089%; PM10: 0.250%; 95% CI: 0.042, 0.459%). The PM2.5 and PM10 levels also had positive associations with admissions for COPD, asthma, and pneumonia. Stratified analyses demonstrated stronger effects in patients more than 45 years old and during the cold season. Total respiratory diseases increased linearly with PM concentration from 0 to 100 μg/m3, and increased more slowly at higher PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This time-series study suggests that short-term exposure to PM increased the risk for hospital admission for respiratory diseases, even at low concentrations. These findings suggest that reducing atmospheric PM concentrations may reduce hospital admissions for respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution has been associated with asthma-related hospital admissions and emergency department visits (hospital encounters). We hypothesized that higher individual exposure to residential traffic-related air pollutants would enhance these associations. METHODS: We studied 11,390 asthma-related hospital encounters among 7492 subjects 0-18 years of age living in Orange County, California. Ambient exposures were measured at regional air monitoring stations. Seasonal average traffic-related exposures (PM2.5, ultrafine particles, NOx, and CO) were estimated near subjects' geocoded residences for 6-month warm and cool seasonal periods, using dispersion models based on local traffic within 500 m radii. Associations were tested in case-crossover conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature and humidity. We assessed effect modification by seasonal residential traffic-related air pollution exposures above and below median dispersion-modeled exposures. Secondary analyses considered effect modification by traffic exposures within race/ethnicity and insurance group strata. RESULTS: Asthma morbidity was positively associated with daily ambient O3 and PM2.5 in warm seasons and with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 in cool seasons. Associations with CO, NOx, and PM2.5 were stronger among subjects living at residences with above-median traffic-related exposures, especially in cool seasons. Secondary analyses showed no consistent differences in association, and 95% confidence intervals were wide, indicating a lack of precision for estimating these highly stratified associations. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of asthma with ambient air pollution were enhanced among subjects living in homes with high traffic-related air pollution. This may be because of increased susceptibility (greater asthma severity) or increased vulnerability (meteorologic amplification of local vs. correlated ambient exposures).",

      "abstract": "Ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution has been linked to elevated hospital admissions (HAs), especially from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have estimated the associations between PM pollution and HAs for a wider range of broad disease categories. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and ≤10 μm (PM10) on a range of broad and specific causes of HAs in Chengdu, China during 2015-2016, using a generalized additive model (GAM). Age-, gender- and season-specific analyses were also performed on the broad categories. We further calculated the corresponding morbidity burden due to PM exposure. During the study period, the daily mean level for PM2.5 and PM10 was 57.3 μg/m3 and 94.7 μg/m3, respectively. For broad disease categories, each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 at lag06 was associated with increments of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.32%-0.99%) in HAs from respiratory, 0.49% (95% CI: 0.04%-0.95%) from circulatory and 0.91% (95% CI: 0.15%-1.69%) from skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases. By contrast, only respiratory HAs showed a significant positive association with elevated PM2.5 at lag06 (1.03% increase per 10 μg/m3, 95% CI: 0.50%-1.56%, p < 0.001). Increased HAs risks for several more refined specific causes within respiratory, circulatory, skin and subcutaneous tissue, nervous and genitourinary diseases were also observed. Subgroup analyses indicated that effect estimates were modified by age, gender and season. Overall, the largest morbidity burden was observed in myocardial infarction, about 11.27% (95% CI: 3.45%-18.07%) and 11.11% (95% CI: 4.07%-17.27%) of HAs for myocardial infarction could be attributable to PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeding the WHO's air quality guidelines (24-h mean: 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 50 μg/m3 for PM10). Our study suggests that both PM2.5 and PM10 increase risks of morbidity from broad range of causes of HAs in Chengdu, and result in substantial morbidity burden.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to ambient particulate matter is associated with adverse health effects. Little is known, however, about which components of the particulate mixture (size, number, source, toxicity) are most relevant to health. We investigated associations of a range of particle metrics with daily deaths and hospital admissions in London. METHODS: Daily concentrations of particle mass (PM10, PM2.5, and PM(10-2.5)), measured using gravimetric, tapered-element-oscillating, and filter-dynamic-measurement-system samplers, as well as particle number concentration and particle composition (carbon, sulfate, nitrate and chloride), were collected from a background monitoring station in central London between 2000 and 2005. All-cause and cause-specific deaths and emergency admissions to hospital in London for the same period were also collected. A Poisson regression time-series model was used in the analysis. RESULTS: The results were not consistent across the various outcomes and lags. Particle number concentration was associated with daily mortality and admissions, particularly for cardiovascular diseases lagged 1-day; increases in particle number concentration (10,166 n/cm3) were associated with 2.2% (95% confidence interval = 0.6% to 3.8%) and 0.6% (-0.4% to 1.7%) increases in cardiovascular deaths and admissions, respectively. Secondary pollutants, especially nonprimary PM2.5, nitrate and sulfate, were more important for respiratory outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidence that specific components of the particle mixture for air pollutants may be relevant to specific diseases. Interpretation should be cautious, however, in particular because exposures were based upon data from a single centrally located monitoring site. There is a need for replication with more comprehensive exposure data, both in London and elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the associations between air pollutants and multiple organ system diseases in the entire hospitalized population. The present study aims to explore the short-term effects of six routinely monitored air pollutants on the broad causes of hospital admissions and estimate the resulting hospital admission burdens. METHODS: Daily hospital admission records from 2017 to 2019 were obtained from the Wuhan Information center of Health and Family Planning. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were employed to evaluate the effects of air pollutants on the percent increase in the cause-specific daily number of hospital admissions. Increased hospital admission numbers, days, and expenses were also estimated. RESULTS: A total of 2636,026 hospital admissions were identified. We found that both PM2.5 and PM10 increased the risk of hospital admissions for most disease categories. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with hospitalizations of several rarely studied disease categories, such as diseases of the eye and adnexa (2.83%, 95%CI: 0.96-4.73%, P < 0.01) and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (2.17%, 95% CI: 0.88-3.47%, P < 0.001). NO2 was observed to have a robust effect on diseases of the respiratory system (1.36%, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98%, P < 0.001). CO was significantly associated with hospital admissions for six disease categories. Furthermore, each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 13,444 hospital admissions (95% CI: 6239-20,649), 124,344 admission days (95% CI: 57,705-190,983), and 166-million-yuan admission expenses (95% CI: 77-255). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that particulate matter (PM) had a short-term effect on hospital admissions of most major disease categories and resulted in a considerable hospital admission burden.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rising pollution plays a crucial role in worsening several respiratory diseases. Particulate Matter (PM)-induced asthma exacerbations are one of the most dangerous events. OBJECTIVES: To assess the correlation between progressive particulate matter short-term exposure and asthma exacerbations, we investigated the role of PM levels on Emergency Department (ED) admissions and hospitalizations for these events in Brescia, an important industrial city located in northern Italy with high yearly levels of air pollution. METHODS: We analyzed 1050 clinical records of ED admissions for suspected asthma exacerbation, starting from January 2014 to December 2017. Daily PM levels were collected from the Environmental Protection Regional Agency. We performed a time-series analysis using a Poisson regression model with single and multiple day-lag. Results were expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and Excess of Relative Risk (ERR) of severe asthma exacerbation over a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5 concentration. RESULTS: We selected and focused our analysis on 543 admissions for indisputable asthma exacerbation in ED and hospital. The time-series study showed an increase of the RR (CI95%) for asthma exacerbation-related ED admissions of 1.24 with an ERR of 24.2% for PM2.5 at lag0-1 (p < 0.05). We also estimated for PM2.5 a RR (CI95%) of 1.12 with an ERR of 12.5% at lag0-5 (p ≤ 0.05). Again, for PM2.5, an increase of the RR (CI95%) for asthma exacerbation-related hospitalizations of 1.31 with an ERR of 30.7% at lag0-1 (p < 0.05) has been documented. These findings were confirmed and even reinforced considering only the population living in the city. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PM exposure, especially for PM2.5, plays a critical role in inducing asthma exacerbation events leading to ED admission or hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of thunderstorm asthma to understand risk factors using high-resolution climate data and asthma outcomes on a large scale are scarce. Moreover, thunderstorm asthma is not well studied in the United States. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether climate parameters involved in thunderstorms are associated with emergency department (ED) visits for acute asthma attacks in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed 63,789 asthma-related, daily ED visits for all age groups, and thunderstorm-associated climate data in Louisiana during 2010 through 2012. We performed time-series analyses using quasi-Poisson regression models with natural cubic splines of date, parish, holiday, day of week, season, daily maximum concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter [PM ≤2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)], and daily mean pressure, precipitation, and temperature. Because of a significant interaction effect between temperature and lightning days on asthma-related visits, we performed stratified analyses by days with/without lightning or thunderstorm (defined by any lightning and precipitation). RESULTS: On thunderstorm days, higher asthma-related ED visits were associated with higher daily mean precipitation [relative risk (RR)=1.145 per 1 g/m2/s (95% CI: 1.009, 1.300)] and lower daily mean temperature [RR=1.011 per 1°C change (1.000-1.021)] without carry-over effect to the next non-thunderstorm day. These higher risks were found mainly among children and adults <65 years of age. We observed similar results on lightning days. However, we did not find similar associations for non-thunderstorm or non-lightning days. Daily maximum O3 and PM2.5 levels were not significantly associated with asthma ED visits on thunderstorm days. DISCUSSION: Higher precipitation and lower temperature on thunderstorm days appear to contribute to asthma attacks among people with asthma, suggesting they should consider taking precautions during thunderstorms. EDs should consider preparing for a potential increase of asthma-related visits and ensuring sufficient stock of emergency medication and supplies for forecasted severe thunderstorm days. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10440.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are few studies on the effects of air pollutants on acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) in children. Here, we investigated the relationship of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the daily number of hospitalizations for ALRI in children in Sichuan Province, China, and to estimate the economic burden of disease due to exposure to air pollutants. METHODS: We collected records of 192,079 cases of childhood ALRI hospitalization between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018 from nine municipal/prefecture medical institutions as well as the simultaneous meteorological and air pollution data from 183 monitoring sites in Sichuan Province. A time series-generalized additive model was used to analyze exposure responses and lagged effects while assessing the economic burden caused by air pollutant exposure after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, day of the week, and meteorological factors. RESULTS: Our single-pollutant model shows that for each 10 μg/m3 increase in air pollutant concentration (1 μg/m3 for SO2), the effect estimates of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 for pneumonia reached their maximum at lag4, lag010, lag010, and lag07, respectively, with relative risk (RR) values of 1.0064 (95% CI, 1.0004-1.0124), 1.0168(95% CI 1.0089-1.0248), 1.0278 (95% CI 1.0157-1.0400), and 1.0378 (95% CI, 1.0072-1.0692). By contrast, the effect estimates of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 for bronchitis all reached their maximum at lag010, with RRs of 1.0133 (95% CI 1.0025-1.0242), 1.0161(95% CI 1.0085-1.0238), 1.0135 (95% CI 1.0025-1.0247), and 1.1133(95% CI 1.0739-1.1541). In addition, children aged 5-14 years were more vulnerable to air pollutants than those aged 0-4 years (p < 0.05). According to the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines, the number of ALRI hospitalizations attributed to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 pollution during the study period was 7551, 10,151, and 7575, respectively, while the incurring economic burden was CNY 2847.06, 3827.27, and 2855.91 million. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in Sichuan Province, elevated daily average concentrations of four air pollutants lead to increases in numbers of childhood ALRI hospitalizations and cause a serious economic burden.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Evidence of short-term effects of ultrafine particles (UFP) on health is still inconsistent and few multicenter studies have been conducted so far especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: Within the UFIREG project, we investigated the short-term effects of UFP and fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) on daily cause-specific hospital admissions in five Central and Eastern European cities using harmonized protocols for measurements and analyses. METHODS: Daily counts of cause-specific hospital admissions focusing on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were obtained for Augsburg and Dresden (Germany), 2011-2012; Chernivtsi (Ukraine), 2013 to March 2014; and Ljubljana (Slovenia) and Prague (Czech Republic), 2012-2013. Air pollution and meteorologic data were measured at fixed monitoring sites in all cities. We analyzed city-specific associations using confounder-adjusted Poisson regression models and pooled the city-specific effect estimates using metaanalysis methods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 2,750 particles/cm3 increase (average interquartile range across all cities) in the 6-day average of UFP indicated a delayed and prolonged increase in the pooled relative risk of respiratory hospital admissions (3.4% [95% confidence interval, -1.7 to 8.8%]). We also found increases in the pooled relative risk of cardiovascular (exposure average of lag 2-5, 1.8% [0.1-3.4%]) and respiratory (6-d average exposure, 7.5% [4.9-10.2%]) admissions per 12.4 μg/m3 increase (average interquartile range) in PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated delayed and prolonged effects of UFP exposure on respiratory hospital admissions in Central and Eastern Europe. Cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions increased in association with an increase in PM2.5. Further multicenter studies are needed using harmonized UFP measurements to draw definite conclusions on health effects of UFP.",

The association between daily PM 2.5 levels and respiratory hospital admissions in San Diego County over a 15-year period from 1999 to 2013 was assessed with a time-series analysis using a multi-level Poisson regression model. Cochran Q tests were used to assess the effect modification of race/ethnicity on this association. Daily fine particle levels varied greatly from 1 μg/m3 to 75.86 μg/m3 (SD = 6.08 μg/m3) with the majority of days falling below 24-hour NAAQS for PM 2.5 of 35 μg/m3. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM 2.5 levels, Black and White individuals had higher rates (8.6% and 6.2%, respectively) of hospitalization for respiratory admissions than observed in the county as a whole (4.1%). Increases in PM 2.5 levels drive an overall increase in respiratory hospital admissions with a disparate burden of health effects by R/E group. These findings suggest an opportunity to design interventions that address the unequal burden of air pollution among vulnerable communities in San Diego County that exist even below NAAQS for daily PM 2.5 concentrations.",

      "abstract": "There have been few studies in non-western countries on the relationship between low levels of daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and morbidity or mortality, and the impact of PM2.5 concentrations below 15 μg/m3, which is the latest World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline (WHO AQG) value for the 24-h mean, is not yet clear. We assessed the associations between low-level PM2.5 exposure and cardiorespiratory admissions in Japan. We collected the daily hospital admission count data, air pollutant data, and meteorological condition data recorded from April 2016 to March 2019 in 139 Japanese cities. City-specific estimates were obtained from conditional logistic regression models in a time-stratified case-crossover design and pooled by random-effect models. We estimated that every 10-μg/m3 increase in the concurrent-day PM2.5 concentration was related to a 0.52% increase in cardiovascular admissions (95% CI: 0.13-0.92%) and a 1.74% increase in respiratory admissions (95% CI: 1.41-2.07%). These values were nearly the same when the datasets were filtered to contain only daily PM2.5 concentrations <15 μg/m3. The exposure-response curves showed approximately sublinear-to-linear curves with no indication of thresholds. These associations with cardiovascular diseases weakened after adjusting for nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide, but associations with respiratory diseases were almost unchanged when additionally adjusted for other pollutants. This study demonstrated that associations between daily PM2.5 and daily cardiorespiratory hospitalizations might persist at low concentrations, including those below the latest WHO AQG value. Our findings suggest that the updated guideline value may still be insufficient from the perspective of public health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Positive associations between ambient PM2.5 and cardiorespiratory disease have been well demonstrated during the past decade. However, few studies have examined the adverse effects of PM2.5 based on an entire population of a megalopolis. In addition, most studies in China have used averaged data, which results in variations between monitoring and personal exposure values, creating an inherent and unavoidable type of measurement error. METHODS: This study was conducted in Wuhan, a megacity in central China with about 10.9 million people. Daily hospital admission records, from October 2016 to December 2018, were obtained from the Wuhan Information center of Health and Family Planning, which administrates all hospitals in Wuhan. Daily air pollution concentrations and weather variables in Wuhan during the study period were collected. We developed a land use regression model (LUR) to assess individual PM2.5 exposure. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate cardiorespiratory hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5. We also conducted stratification analyses by age, sex, and season. RESULTS: A total of 2,806,115 hospital admissions records were collected during the study period, from which we identified 332,090 cardiovascular disease admissions and 159,365 respiratory disease admissions. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of a cardiorespiratory hospital admission. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (lag0-2 days) was associated with an increase in hospital admissions of 1.23% (95% CI 1.01-1.45%) and 1.95% (95% CI 1.63-2.27%) for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. The elderly were at higher PM-induced risk. The associations appeared to be more evident in the cold season than in the warm season. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes evidence of short-term effects of PM2.5 on cardiorespiratory hospital admissions, which may be helpful for air pollution control and disease prevention in Wuhan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Particulate matter (PM) from traffic and other sources has been associated with adverse health effects. One unifying theory is that PM, whatever its source, acts on the human body via its capacity to cause damaging oxidation reactions related to its content of pro-oxidants components. Few epidemiological studies have investigated particle oxidative potential (OP) and health. We conducted a time series analysis to assess associations between daily particle OP measures and numbers of deaths and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. METHODS: During 2011 and 2012 particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10μm (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) were collected daily on Partisol filters located at an urban background monitoring station in Central London. Particulate OP was assessed based on the capacity of the particles to oxidize ascorbate (OP(AA)) and glutathione (OP(GSH)) from a simple chemical model reflecting the antioxidant composition of human respiratory tract lining fluid. Particulate OP, expressed as % loss of antioxidant per μg of PM, was then multiplied by the daily concentrations of PM to derive the daily OP of PM mass concentrations (% loss per m(3)). Daily numbers of deaths and age- and cause-specific hospital admissions in London were obtained from national registries. Poisson regression accounting for seasonality and meteorology was used to estimate the percentage change in risk of death or admission associated with an interquartile increment in particle OP. RESULTS: We found little evidence for adverse associations between OP(AA) and OP(GSH) and mortality. Associations with cardiovascular admissions were generally positive in younger adults and negative in older adults with confidence intervals including 0%. For respiratory admissions there was a trend, from positive to negative associations, with increasing age although confidence intervals generally included 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, the first to analyse daily particle OP measures and mortality and admissions in a large population over two years, found little evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term exposure to particle OP is associated with adverse health effects. Further studies with improved exposure assessment and longer time series are required to confirm or reject the role of particle OP in triggering exacerbations of disease.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies utilizing source apportionment (SA) of fine particulate matter have shown that particles from certain sources might be more detrimental to health than others; however, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given SA approach. In the present study, we examined associations between source contributions of fine particulate matter and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma in Atlanta, Georgia (2002-2010) using a novel ensemble-based SA technique. Six daily source contributions from 4 SA approaches were combined into an ensemble source contribution. To better account for exposure uncertainty, 10 source profiles were sampled from their posterior distributions, resulting in 10 time series with daily SA concentrations. For each of these time series, Poisson generalized linear models with varying lag structures were used to estimate the health associations for the 6 sources. The rate ratios for the source-specific health associations from the 10 imputed source contribution time series were combined, resulting in health associations with inflated confidence intervals to better account for exposure uncertainty. Adverse associations with pediatric asthma were observed for 8-day exposure to particles generated from diesel-fueled vehicles (rate ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.10) and gasoline-fueled vehicles (rate ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.17).",

The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was applied to estimate the short-term effect of ambient PM on respiratory disease hospitalization. As the second analysis, respiratory disease hospitalizations during two distinct air pollution periods were analyzed. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in same-day exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease hospitalization by 1.95% (0.25, 3.67) and 1.63% (0.16, 3.12), respectively. The effect of PM2.5 or PM10 on asthma hospitalizations were 4.67% (1.23, 8.23) and 4.04% (1.06, 7.11), respectively (p < 0.05). The 65+ years age group had a higher risk associated with PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases on the same day (2.74% and 2.28%, respectively). Compared to the lower ambient air pollution period, higher increased hospital admissions were observed among those aged above 65 years, males, and COPD and pneumonia hospital admissions during the high ambient air pollution period.

Information on the impact of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) from landscape fires (LFs) on cardiorespiratory hospital admissions is limited. METHODS: We conducted a population-based time series study to assess associations between modelled daily elevated PM 2.5 at a 1.5×1.5 km resolution using a modified empirical PM 2.5 exposure model during LFs and hospital admissions for all-cause and cause-specific respiratory and cardiovascular diseases for the study period (2015-2017) in Perth, Western Australia. Multivariate Poisson regressions were used to estimate cumulative risk ratios (RR) with lag effects of 0-3 days, adjusted for sociodemographic factors, weather and time. RESULTS: All-cause hospital admissions and overall cardiovascular admissions increased significantly across each elevated PM 2.5 concentration on most lag days, with the strongest associations of 3% and 7%, respectively, at the high level of ≥12.60 µg/m3 on lag 1 day. For asthma hospitalisation, there was an excess relative risk of up to 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35) with same-day exposure for all people, up to 93% on a lag of 1 day in children and up to 52% on a lag of 3 days in low sociodemographic groups.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide essential information of environmental triggers leading to CRD. METHODS: We investigated the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants on CRD-related hospitalizations in people aged ≥ 65 years in Ningbo. Data on 23,610 cases of CRD requiring hospitalization were collected from January 2015 to August 2017. After adjusting for temporal trends, seasonality, meteorological conditions, day of week (DOW), and public holidays, we used generalized additive Poisson distribution models to calculate the excess risks (ERs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CRD related hospitalizations. RESULTS: Our results showed that fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated with CRD-related hospitalizations in people aged ≥ 65 years. We observed that each 10 μg/m3 increase (except for each 0.1 mg/m3 increase in CO) in the concentration of air pollutants, the percentage of CRD-related hospitalizations due to PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 exposure at lag 07, NO2 exposure at lag 03, and CO exposure at lag 0 increased by 2.13% (95% CI: 0.55%, 3.74%), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.70%, 2.83%), 8.24% (95% CI: 0.92%, 16.09%), 2.16% (95% CI: 0.26%, 4.05%), and 1.19% (95% CI: 0.26%, 2.12%), respectively. In addition, we found stronger effects of particulate matter in 75-84 years age group, on warmer days, and in asthmatics.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Western Montana, USA, experiences complex air pollution patterns with predominant exposure sources from summer wildfire smoke and winter wood smoke. In addition, climate change related temperatures events are becoming more extreme and expected to contribute to increases in hospital admissions for a range of health outcomes. Evaluating while accounting for these exposures (air pollution and temperature) that often occur simultaneously and may act synergistically on health is becoming more important. METHODS: We explored short-term exposure to air pollution on children's respiratory health outcomes and how extreme temperature or seasonal period modify the risk of air pollution-associated healthcare events. The main outcome measure included individual-based address located respiratory-related healthcare visits for three categories: asthma, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) across western Montana for ages 0-17 from 2017-2020. We used a time-stratified, case-crossover analysis with distributed lag models to identify sensitive exposure windows of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) lagged from 0 (same-day) to 14 prior-days modified by temperature or season. RESULTS: For asthma, increases of 1 µg/m3 in PM2.5 exposure 7-13 days prior a healthcare visit date was associated with increased odds that were magnified during median to colder temperatures and winter periods. For LRTIs, 1 µg/m3 increases during 12 days of cumulative PM2.5 with peak exposure periods between 6-12 days before healthcare visit date was associated with elevated LRTI events, also heightened in median to colder temperatures but no seasonal effect was observed. For URTIs, 1 unit increases during 13 days of cumulative PM2.5 with peak exposure periods between 4-10 days prior event date was associated with greater risk for URTIs visits that were intensified during median to hotter temperatures and spring to summer periods. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed, short-term exposure increases of PM2.5 were associated with elevated odds of all three pediatric respiratory healthcare visit categories in a sparsely population area of the inter-Rocky Mountains, USA. PM2.5 in colder temperatures tended to increase instances of asthma and LRTIs, while PM2.5 during hotter periods increased URTIs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to air pollution has been demonstrated in previous studies to correlate with respiratory disease (RD) in children. Due to regional heterogeneity, our objective was to explore the correlation between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and hospital admissions for respiratory ailments in children in Suzhou City from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022, alongside assessing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on this relationship. METHODS: We collected data on air pollutant levels and hospital admissions for childhood respiratory disease (RD) in Suzhou, China, from 2017 to 2022. We utilized a time-stratified case-crossover design along with a conditional logistic regression model to assess the short-term impacts of air pollutants on RD in children through stratified analysis and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 13,408 children with respiratory diseases were included in the study. The findings revealed significant associations between hospitalization for respiratory diseases in children and exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO. The maximum effect values (95%CI, best lag days) for each 10 µg/m3 increase in the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were as follows: 1.017 (1.003-1.031, lag0-2), 1.015 (1.004-1.026, lag0-2), 1.117 (1.001-1.247, lag0-1), and 1.036 (1.009-1.064, lag0-7). Additionally, the maximum effect value (95%CI, best lag days) for each 1 mg/m3 increase in CO concentration was found to be 1.267 1.017-1.579, lag0-7). Stratified analysis indicated that sex, season of admission, and stage of admission did not modify these correlations significantly; however, differential effects on various age groups and sexes were primarily observed among school-age and older children as well as boys. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO in Suzhou, China, exhibited a positive correlation with RD hospitalization. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse impacts of air pollutants on hospitalizations for childhood respiratory disease were mitigated compared to the period following the pandemic. Local governments should continue promoting decisions and measures for air pollution prevention and control to reduce further pollutant concentration, which is crucial for public health in reducing the burden of childhood respiratory diseases.",

Using a time-series study design, we investigated possible effect modification by respiratory virus infections of the associations between aeroallergens/PM2.5 and asthma exacerbation rates. Outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient visits for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma (28,540/24,444 [warm/cold season]), as well as viral infection counts were obtained from electronic health records of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2011 to 2016.

However, similar trends were not observed for weed pollens/molds or PM2.5. Overall, our study provides little evidence supporting effect modification by respiratory viral infections.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on association between air pollutants and hospital admissions, hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and comorbid respiratory diseases (RD), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with low levels of air pollution. METHODS: Daily data on RD-DM patients were collected in Panzhihua from 2016 to 2020. A generalised additive model (GAM) was used to explore the effect of air pollutants on daily hospital admissions, LOS and hospital cost. Attributable risk was employed to estimate RD-DM's burden due to exceeding air pollution exposure, using both 0 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3) and WHO's 2021 air quality guidelines as reference. RESULTS: For each 10 ug/m3 increase of particles with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 micron (μm) (PM2.5), particles with an aerodynamic diameter <10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), the admissions of RD-DM patients increased by 7.25% (95% CI = 4.26 to 10.33), 5.59% (95% CI = 3.79 to 7.42), 10.10% (95% CI = 7.29 to 12.98), 12.33% (95% CI = 8.82 to 15.95) and -2.99% (95% CI = -4.08 to -1.90); per 1 milligramme per cubic metre (mg/m3) increase of carbon monoxide (CO) corresponded to a 25.77% (95% CI = 17.88 to 34.19) increment for admissions of RD-DM patients. For LOS and hospital cost, the six air pollutants showed similar effect. Given 0 μg/m3 as the reference, NO2 showed the maximum attributable fraction of 32.68% (95% CI = 25.12 to 39.42%), corresponding to an avoidable burden of 5661 (95% CI = 3611 to 5860) patients with RD-DM. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO with increased hospital admissions, LOS and hospital cost in patients with RD-DM. Disease burden of RD-DM may be improved by formulating policies related to air pollutants exposure reduction, especially in LMICs with low levels of air pollution.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) are prevalent in the general population. However, studies on the association of short-term exposure to air pollution with the risk of hospital visits for AURTIs in adults are limited. This study aimed to explore the short-term exposure to air pollutants among Chinese adults living in Ningbo. METHODS: Quasi-Poisson time serious regressions with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were applied to explore the association between ambient air pollution and AURTIs cases. Patients ≥ 18 years who visit three hospitals, being representative for urban, urban-rural junction and rural were included in this retrospective study. RESULTS: In total, 104,441 cases with AURTIs were enrolled in hospital during 2015-2019. The main results showed that particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen dioxide (SO2), were positively associated to hospital visits for AURTIs, except for nitrogen dioxide (O3), which was not statistically significant. The largest single-lag effect for PM2.5 at lag 8 days (RR = 1.02, 95%CI: 1.08-1.40), for NO2 at lag 13 days (RR = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00-1.06) and for SO2 at lag 5 days (RR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.08-1.48), respectively. In the stratified analysis, females, and young adults (18-60 years) were more vulnerable to PM2.5 and SO2 and the effect was greater in rural areas and urban-rural junction. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ambient air pollution was significantly associated with hospital visits for AURTIs. This study provides epidemiological evidence for policymakers to control better air quality and establish an enhanced system of air pollution alerts.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health risks due to particulate matter (PM) from wildfires may differ from risk due to PM from other sources. In places frequently subjected to wildfire smoke, such as Reno, Nevada, it is critical to determine whether wildfire PM poses unique risks. Our goal was to quantify the difference in the association of adverse asthma events with PM on days when wildfire smoke was present versus days when wildfire smoke was not present. METHODS: We obtained counts of visits for asthma at emergency departments and urgent care centers from a large regional healthcare system in Reno for the years 2013-2018. We also obtained dates when wildfire smoke was present from the Washoe County Health District Air Quality Management Division. We then examined whether the presence of wildfire smoke modified the association of PM2.5, PM10-2.5, and PM10 with asthma visits using generalized additive models. We improved on previous studies by excluding wildfire-smoke days where the PM concentration exceeded the maximum PM concentration on other days, thus accounting for possible nonlinearity in the association between PM concentration and asthma visits. RESULTS: Air quality was affected by wildfire smoke on 188 days between 2013 and 2018. We found that the presence of wildfire smoke increased the association of a 5 μg/m3 increase in daily and three-day averages of PM2.5 with asthma visits by 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-10.3%) and 6.8% (CI: 1.2-12.7%), respectively. Similarly, the presence of wildfire smoke increased the association of a 5 μg/m3 increase in daily and three-day averages of PM10 with asthma visits by 5.5% (CI: 2.5-8.6%) and 7.2% (CI: 2.6-12.0%), respectively. We did not observe any significant increases in association for PM10-2.5 or for seven-day averages of PM2.5 and PM10. CONCLUSIONS: Since we found significantly stronger associations of PM2.5 and PM10 with asthma visits when wildfire smoke was present, our results suggest that wildfire PM is more hazardous than non-wildfire PM for patients with asthma.",

This study evaluated the short-term effects of PM2.5 on hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with additional analyses to identify vulnerable populations based on regional characteristics. The present study analyzed data from 249 Korean communities between 2006 and 2021. Data on daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service. Data on PM2.5 concentrations were sourced from air quality modeling. Additional data on regional characteristics, including the regional deprivation index, proportion of elderly residents, education levels, and greenness levels, were also collected. We used case time series analysis to assess the associations between PM2.5 concentrations and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and explored effect modification by regional characteristics with stratified analyses. The mean numbers of daily cardiovascular admissions and respiratory admissions were 5.68 ± 5.46 and 6.46 ± 8.03, respectively. The mean PM2.5 concentrations were 23.58 ± 13.66 μg/m3. A10 μg/m³ increment in daily PM2.5 concentration was associated with increase of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalization by 0.94% (95% CI: 0.84%, 1.04%) and 1.43% (95% CI: 1.34%, 1.52%), respectively. Regional characteristics analysis showed significant disparities, with higher risks for hospital admissions in areas with lower deprivation and low greenness. This study highlights the significant short-term health impacts of PM2.5 on respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Korean communities. The findings underscore the critical role of regional and demographic factors in modulating these effects, identifying socio-economic areas, age structure of the population, lower education levels, and low greenness as key vulnerability factors.",

Around 40,002 patients with COPD admitted to 110 hospitals were included in this study. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models was applied to assess the effects of PM2.5 based on a 1-km grid data of aerosol optical depth provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on hospital admissions for COPD. Further, we performed stratified analyses by individual demographic characteristics and season of hospital admission. Around 10 μg/m3 increase in individual-level PM2.5 was associated with an increase of 1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6%, 2.7%) in hospitalization for COPD at a lag of 0-5 days.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Increased air pollutant concentrations have been linked to several asthma-related outcomes in children, including respiratory symptoms, medication use, and hospital visits. However, few studies have examined effects of ultrafine particles in a pediatric population. Our primary objective was to examine the effects of ambient concentrations of ultrafine particles on asthma exacerbation among urban children and determine whether consistent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids could attenuate these effects. We also explored the relationship between asthma exacerbation and ambient concentrations of accumulation mode particles, fine particles (≤2.5 micrograms [μm]; PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. We hypothesized that increased 1-7 day concentrations of ultrafine particles and other pollutants would be associated with increases in the relative odds of an asthma exacerbation, but that this increase in risk would be attenuated among children receiving school-based corticosteroid therapy. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study using data from 3 to 10 year-old children participating in the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial. Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we estimated the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit treated with prednisone (n=96 visits among 74 children) associated with increased pollutant concentrations in the previous 7 days. We re-ran these analyses separately for children receiving medications through the school-based intervention and children in a usual care control group. RESULTS: Interquartile range increases in ultrafine particles and carbon monoxide concentrations in the previous 7 days were associated with increases in the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit, with the largest increases observed for 4-day mean ultrafine particles (interquartile range=2088p/cm(3); OR=1.27; 95% CI=0.90-1.79) and 7-day mean carbon monoxide (interquartile range=0.17ppm; OR=1.63; 95% CI=1.03-2.59). Relative odds estimates were larger among children receiving school-based inhaled corticosteroid treatment. We observed no such associations with accumulation mode particles, black carbon, fine particles (≤2.5μm), or sulfur dioxide. Ozone concentrations were inversely associated with the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a response to markers of traffic pollution among urban asthmatic children. Effects were strongest among children receiving preventive medications through school, suggesting that this group of children was particularly sensitive to environmental triggers. Medication adherence alone may be insufficient to protect the most vulnerable from environmental asthma triggers. However, further research is necessary to confirm this finding.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Our results provide evidence for respiratory effects of combined exposure to airborne pollutants in Santiago de Chile. Different pollutants account for varying adverse effects. Ozone was not found to be significantly associated with respiratory morbidity. BACKGROUND: High concentrations of various air pollutants have been associated with hospitalization due to development and exacerbation of respiratory diseases. The findings of different studies vary in effect strength and are sometimes inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess associations between airborne exposures by particulate matter as well as gaseous air pollutants and hospital admissions due to respiratory disease groups under the special orographic and meteorological conditions of Santiago de Chile. METHODS: The study was performed in the metropolitan area of Santiago de Chile during 2004-2007. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover analysis taking temporal variation, meteorological conditions and autocorrelation into account. We computed associations between daily ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5 - particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 or 2.5 μm, respectively) or ozone (O3) and hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses. RESULTS: We found for CO, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 adverse relationships to respiratory admissions while effect strength and lag depended on the pollutant and on the disease group. By trend, in 1-pollutant models most adverse pollutants were CO and PM10 followed by PM2.5, while in 2-pollutant models effects of NO2 persisted in most cases whereas other effects weakened and significant effects remain for PM2.5, only. In addition the strongest effects seemed to be immediate or with a delay of up to one day, but effects were found until day 7, too. Adverse effects of ozone could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Taking case numbers and effect strength of all cardiovascular diseases into account, mitigation measures should address all pollutants especially CO, NO2, and PM10.",

      "abstract": "Existing PM2.5-morbidity studies using daily mean concentration as exposure metric may fail to capture intra-day variations of PM2.5 concentrations, resulting in underestimated health impacts to some extent. This study introduced a novel indicator, daily excessive concentration hours (DECH), defined as sums of per-hourly excessive concentrations of PM2.5 against a specific threshold within a day. PM2.5 DECHs were separately calculated as daily concentration-hours >8, 10, 15, 20, and 25 μg/m3 (abbreviations: DECH-8, DECH-10, DECH-15, DECH-20, and DECH-25). We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models to compare risks of hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with PM2.5 mean and DECHs in Shenzhen, China. We observed highly comparable PM2.5-COPD associations using exposure metrics of daily mean and DECHs with above-defined thresholds. For instance, PM2.5 mean and DECHs showed similar increases in risks of COPD hospitalization for an interquartile range rise in exposure, with odds ratio estimates of 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.50) for PM2.5 mean, 1.24 (1.05-1.46) for DECH-10 and 1.21 (1.06-1.39) for DECH-25, respectively. Findings remained robust after further adjusting for gaseous pollutants (e.g., SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) and meteorologic factors (e.g., wind speed and air pressure). Our study strengthened the evidence that DECHs could come be as a novel exposure metric in health risk assessments associated with short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the short-term impacts of ambient particulate matter (PM) pollution on morbidity in China. The aims of this study were to examine the short-term association between hospital admissions and ambient PM and also to explore whether PM2.5 at levels below current regulatory limits also increases the risk of hospitalizations in 26 Chinese cities. METHODS: We identified 14,569,622 all-cause, 2,008,786 cardiovascular, and 916,388 respiratory admissions during 2014-2015. We employed conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between hospital admissions and ambient PM. RESULTS: A 10 μg/m increase in PM2.5 at lag 0 day corresponded to increases of 0.19% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18%, 0.20%) in all-cause, 0.23% (95% CI = 0.20%, 0.26%) in cardiovascular, and 0.26% (95% CI = 0.22%, 0.31%) in respiratory admissions. For PM10, the values were 0.12% (95% CI = 0.11%, 0.13%) for all-cause, 0.15% (95% CI = 0.13%, 0.17%) for cardiovascular, and 0.21% (95% CI = 0.17%, 0.24%) for respiratory admissions. The associations held at PM2.5 levels below the current Chinese and European/WHO standards. Among individuals with exposure levels below 25 μg/m, increasing PM2.5 levels from below 15 μg/m to above 15 μg/m was associated with increases of 1.8% (odds ratio, 1.018; 95% CI = 1.015, 1.022) in all-cause admissions and 2.5% (odds ratio, 1.025; 95% CI = 1.017, 1.034) in cardiovascular admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PM exposures were associated with increased hospitalizations, even for exposure levels not exceeding the current regulatory limits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although air pollution is a serious problem in Ahvaz, the association between air pollution and respiratory diseases has not been studied enough in this area. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between short-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of hospital admissions due to asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis in Ahvaz. METHODS: Hospital admissions data and air pollutants including O3, NO, NO2, SO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 were obtained from 2008 to 2018. Adjusted Quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag model, controlled for trend, seasonality, weather, weekdays, and holidays was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in hospital admissions for asthma (RR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007) and COPD (RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.005) associated with PM2.5. PM10 was associated with increased hospital admissions due to bronchiectasis in both genders (Men: RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006) (Female: RR=1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006). NO2 was also associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for asthma (RR=1.040, 95% CI: 1.008-1.074) and COPD (RR=1.049, 95% CI: 1.010-1.090). SO2 was associated with the risk of hospital admissions of asthma (RR=1.069, 95% CI: 1.017-1.124) and bronchiectasis (RR=1.030, 95% CI: 1.005-1.056). Finally, CO was associated with COPD (RR=1.643, 95% CI: 1.233-2.191) and bronchiectasis (RR=1.542, 95% CI: 1.035-2.298) hospital admissions. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to air pollutants significantly increases the risk of hospital admissions for asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis in the adult and elderly population.",

      "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine whether there was a correlation between fine particles (PM2.5) levels and hospital admissions for pneumonia in Taipei, Taiwan. Hospital admissions for pneumonia and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period from 2006 to 2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions for pneumonia was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single-pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased numbers of admissions for pneumonia were significantly associated with higher PM2.5 levels both on warm days (>23°C) and on cool days (<23°C). This was accompanied by an interquartile range elevation correlated with a 12% (95% CI = 16%-13%) and 4% (95% CI = 3%-6%) rise in number of admissions for pneumonia, respectively. In the two-pollutant models, PM2.5 remained significant after inclusion of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) or ozone (O₃) both on warm and on cool days. This study provides evidence that higher levels of PM2.5 increase the risk of hospital admissions for pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "Although respiratory disease has been strongly connected to fine particulate air pollution (particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5)), evidence has been mixed regarding the effects of coarse particles (particulate matter from 2.5 to 10 μm in diameter), possibly because of the greater spatial heterogeneity of coarse particles. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between coarse particles and respiratory emergency department visits, including common subdiagnoses, from 2005 to 2008 in 35 California counties. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to help control for time-invariant confounders and seasonal influences, and the study population was limited to those residing within 20 km of pollution monitors to mitigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity. Significant associations between respiratory emergency department visits and coarse particle levels were observed. Asthma visits showed associations (for 2-day lag, excess risk per 10 μg/m³ = 3.3%, 95% confidence interval: 2.0, 4.6) that were robust to adjustment by other common air pollutants (particles <2.5 μm in diameter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide). Pneumonia and acute respiratory infection visits were not associated, although some suggestion of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits was present. Our results indicate that coarse particle exposure may trigger asthma exacerbations requiring emergency care, and reducing exposures among asthmatic persons may provide benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the relationship between air pollution and hospital admissions for asthma in older adults, and to further assess the health and economic burden of asthma admissions attributable to air pollution. METHODS: We collected information on asthma cases in people over 65 years of age from nine cities in Sichuan province, as well as air pollution and meteorological data. The relationship between short-term air pollutant exposure and daily asthma hospitalizations was analyzed using the generalized additive model (GAM), and stratified by gender, age, and season. In addition, we assessed the economic burden of hospitalization for air pollution-related asthma in older adults using the cost of disease approach. RESULTS: The single pollutant model showed that every 1 mg/m3 increase in CO was linked with an increase in daily hospitalizations for older adults with asthma, with relative risk values of 1.327 (95% CI: 1.116-1.577) at lag7. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, on asthma hospitalization, with relative risk values of 1.044 (95% CI: 1.011-1.078), 1.018 (95% CI: 1.002-1.034), 1.013 (95% CI: 1.004-1.022), 1.015 (95% CI: 1.003-1.028) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.041-1.227), respectively. Stratified analysis shows that stronger associations between air pollution and asthma HAs among older adult in females, those aged 65-69 years, and in the warm season, although all of the differences between subgroups did not reach statistical significance. During the study period, the number of asthma hospitalizations attributable to PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 pollution was 764, 581 and 95, respectively, which resulted in a total economic cost of 6.222 million CNY, 4.73 million CNY and 0.776 million CNY, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that short-term exposure to air pollutants is positively associated with an increase in numbers of asthma of people over 65 years of age in Sichuan province, and short-term exposure to excessive PM and NO2 brings health and economic burden to individuals and society.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term exposure to high Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations worsens several respiratory conditions. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between short-term exposure to Particulate Matter and fine Particulate Matter (PM10 - PM2.5) and Emergency Department (ED) admissions and hospitalizations for COPD exacerbation observed at the University Hospital, Spedali Civili of Brescia, a city with some of the highest yearly levels of air pollution in Italy. METHODS: We collected data from patients admitted to the ED with a COPD exacerbation diagnosis, starting from January 2014 to January 2016. Daily PM levels were collected from the Environmental Protection Regional Agency (ARPA). We performed a time-series analysis using the Poisson regression model with single and multiple day-lag. Results were expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and Excess of Relative Risk (ER) for COPD exacerbation-related ED admissions and hospitalizations, over a 10μg/m3 increase in PM concentration. RESULTS: We collected data from 431 COPD patients. Both PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly associated with the risk of COPD exacerbation-related ED admission and hospitalization. Each increase of 10μg/m3 of PM10 and PM2.5 corresponded respectively to a RR for ED admissions of 1.06 and 1.08 at lag0-1; 1.06 and 1.09 at lag0-5 (p < 0.05). Similar results for COPD Exacerbation-related hospitalizations were found, with a RR of 1.07 and 1.10 at lag0-1 and 1.07 and 1.11 at lag0-5 for each increase of 10μg/m3 PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that in a highly polluted city of Northern Italy, short-term increase in exposure to PM10-PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of ED admission and hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation with a greater incidence during the winter season.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Whereas associations between air pollution and respiratory morbidity for adults 65 years and older are well documented in the United States, the evidence for people under 65 is less extensive. To address this gap, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program collected respiratory emergency department (ED) data from 17 states. OBJECTIVES: To estimate age-specific acute effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (particulate matter ≤2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) on respiratory ED visits. METHODS: We conducted time-series analyses in 894 counties by linking daily respiratory ED visits with estimated ozone and PM2.5 concentrations during the week before the date of the visit. Overall effect estimates were obtained with a Bayesian hierarchical model to combine county estimates for each pollutant by age group (children, 0-18; adults, 19-64; adults ≥ 65, and all ages) and by outcome group (acute respiratory infection, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and all respiratory ED visits). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rate ratios (95% credible interval) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and all respiratory ED visits were 1.024 (1.018-1.029) among children, 1.008 (1.004-1.012) among adults younger than 65 years, and 1.002 (0.996-1.007) among adults 65 and older. Per 20-ppb increase in ozone, rate ratios were 1.017 (1.011-1.023) among children, 1.051 (1.046-1.056) among adults younger than 65, and 1.033 (1.026-1.040) among adults 65 and older. Associations varied in magnitude by age group for each outcome group. CONCLUSIONS: These results address a gap in the evidence used to ensure adequate public health protection under national air pollution policies.",

      "abstract": "While many studies have investigated the health effects associated with acute exposure to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5)), very few have considered the risks of specific sources of PM2.5 We used city-specific source apportionment in 8 major metropolitan areas in California from 2005-2009 to examine the associations of source-specific PM2.5 exposures from vehicular emissions, biomass burning, soil, and secondary nitrate and sulfate sources with emergency department visits (EDVs) for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including 7 subclasses. Using a case-crossover analysis, we observed associations of vehicular emissions with all cardiovascular EDVs (excess risk = 1.6%, 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 2.4 for an interquartile-range increment of 2.8 µg/m(3)) and with several subclasses of disease. In addition, vehicular emissions, biomass burning, and soil sources were associated with all respiratory EDVs and with EDVs for asthma. The soil source, which includes resuspended road dust, generated the highest risk estimate for asthma (excess risk = 4.5%, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 8.0). Overall, our results provide additional evidence of the public health consequences of exposure to specific sources of PM2.5 and indicate that some sources of PM2.5 may pose higher risks than the overall PM2.5 mass.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found associations between asthma morbidity and air pollution especially in young population, (PLoS One 12:e0180522, 2017; Can J Public Health 103:4-8, 2012; Environ Health Perspect 118:449-57, 2010; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 182:307-16, 2010; J Allergy Clin Immunol 104:717-22, 2008; J Allergy Clin Immunol 104:717-22, 1999; Environ Res 111:1137-47, 2011) but most of them were conducted in areas with relatively low air pollutant level. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the effect and burden modification of heating season during which the ambient air pollution level is significantly different from that during non-heating season in north China. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect and burden modification of heating on short-term associations between adult asthma hospitalizations and ambient air pollution in the north China city of Shijiazhuang. METHODS: Generalized additive models combined with penalized distributed lag nonlinear models were used to model associations between daily asthma hospitalizations and ambient air pollutants from 1 January 2013 to 16 December 2016 in Shijiazhuang city, adjusting for long-term and seasonality trend, day of week, statutory holiday, daily mean air pressure and temperature. Attributable risks were calculated to evaluate the burden of asthma hospitalizations due to air pollutants exposure. The effect of pollutants on hospitalization and the attributable measures were estimated in heating and non-heating season separately and the comparisons between the two seasons were conducted. RESULTS: All pollutants demonstrated positive and significant impacts on asthma hospitalizations both in heating season and non-heating season, except for O3 in heating season where a negative association was observed. However, the differences of the pollutant-specific effects between the two seasons were not significant. SO2 and NO2 exposure were associated with the heaviest burden among all pollutants in heating season; meanwhile, PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with the heaviest burden in heating season. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found evidence of the effect of ambient air pollutants on asthma hospitalizations in Shijiazhuang. The central heating period could modify the effects in terms of attributable risks. The disease burden modification of heating should be taken into consideration when planning intervention measures to reduce the risk of asthma hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the natural gas industry to meet the global demand have raised environmental health concerns. Few studies have found that areas with natural gas industrial activity have poor air quality. However, the negative health impacts of ambient air pollution in a natural gas industrial area remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollution and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children in a natural gas industrial area in Bintulu, Malaysia. Daily hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children were collected from a hospital in Bintulu from 2010 to 2019. Data on six air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) in the study area were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia. Quasi-Poisson time series regressions with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were applied to explore the associations between ambient air pollution and childhood hospitalisations for respiratory diseases. Stratification analyses were performed by gender and age group to identify the vulnerable populations. A 10 μg/m3 increased PM2.5 and SO2 was associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children with the greatest relative risk of RR 1.089 (95% CI 1.001-1.183) at cumulative lag 0-2 days and RR 1.229 (95% CI 1.073-1.409) at cumulative lag 0-6 days, respectively. There was no significant association between short-term exposure of PM10, NO2, CO, and O3 with childhood respiratory hospitalisation. The association between PM2.5 and SO2 exposure and hospital admissions for childhood respiratory diseases in the two pollutants model remained statistically significant. There were stronger associations in younger children aged 0-4 years and girls. This study reveals that short-term exposure to SO2 was associated with a higher risk of respiratory hospitalisations among children in Bintulu than PM2.5. Better air quality control is necessary for children's health living in the natural gas industrial area.",

This study aimed to explore the acute effects of four air pollutants [fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] on the daily number of children admitted to the hospital for acute bronchitis in Sichuan Province, China. METHODS: The 49,975 records of hospitalized children with acute bronchitis from medical institutions in nine cities/prefectures, Sichuan Province, China, as well as the simultaneous meteorological data and air pollution data from 183 monitoring sites, were collected from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. A generalized additive model was adopted to analyze the exposure-response and lag effects of hospitalizations of children with acute bronchitis to air pollutants. Stratified analyses were conducted based on sex, age, and season. RESULTS: The single-pollutant model showed that a 10 µg/m3 increase at lag07 of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 corresponded to an increase of 1.23% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-2.26%], 1.33% (95% CI 0.62-2.05%), 23.52% (95% CI 11.52-36.81%), and 12.47% (95% CI 8.46-16.64%) in daily hospitalizations for children with acute bronchitis, respectively. Children aged 0-2 were more prone to PM2.5 (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the effects were stronger in the warm season than in transition seasons and the cool season for PM2.5 and PM10 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The higher daily average concentrations of four pollutants in Sichuan Province can result in an increased number of children hospitalized for acute bronchitis.",

Relatively little research has been conducted to assess whether age is a factor conferring susceptibility to air pollution-related asthma morbidity. We investigated the short-term relationships between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and ambient ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Atlanta (1993-2009), Dallas (2006-2009), and St. Louis (2001-2007). City-specific daily time-series analyses were conducted to estimate associations by age group (0-4, 5-18, 19-39, 40-64, and 65+ years). Sub-analyses were performed stratified by race and sex. City-specific rate ratios (RRs) were combined by inverse-variance weighting to provide an overall association for each strata. The overall RRs differed across age groups, with associations for all pollutants consistently strongest for children aged 5-18 years. The patterns of association across age groups remained generally consistent when models were stratified by sex and race, although the strong observed associations among 5-18 year olds appeared to be partially driven by non-white and male patients. Our findings suggest that age is a susceptibility factor for asthma exacerbations in response to air pollution, with school-age children having the highest susceptibility.",

Diagnoses of tracheitis and laryngitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and asthma were included. INMET provided data on maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity. Statistical analysis was performed with three generalized additive Poisson regression models, one of which only included the minimum temperature, another including the pollutant and the last with an interaction variable. There were 1,612 hospitalizations in the period; in the multivariate model, associations were identified between minimum temperature and hospitalizations in lags 1 to 5; the effect of increasing the minimum temperature by 4°C resulted in an increase in the risk of hospitalizations by 18%; 15.2% of hospitalizations are attributed to this increase and an excess of approximately US$ 68,000.00 in expenses for the health system during the period evaluated.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) visit and hospital admissions (HA) data have been an indispensible resource for assessing acute morbidity impacts of air pollution. ED visits and HAs are types of health care visits with similarities, but also potentially important differences. Little previous information is available regarding the impact of health care visit type on observed acute air pollution-health associations from studies conducted for the same location, time period, outcome definitions and model specifications. METHODS: As part of a broader study of air pollution and health in St. Louis, individual-level ED and HA data were obtained for a 6.5 year period for acute care hospitals in the eight Missouri counties of the St. Louis metropolitan area. Patient demographic characteristics and diagnostic code distributions were compared for four visit types including ED visits, HAs, HAs that came through the ED, and non-elective HAs. Time-series analyses of the relationship between daily ambient ozone and PM₂.₅ and selected cardiorespiratory outcomes were conducted for each visit type. RESULTS: Our results indicate that, compared with ED patients, HA patients tended to be older, had evidence of greater severity for some outcomes, and had a different mix of specific outcomes. Consideration of 'HA through ED' appeared to more effectively select acute visits than consideration of 'non-elective HA'. While outcomes with the strongest observed temporal associations with air pollutants tended to show strong associations for all visit types, we found some differences in observed associations for ED visits and HAs. For example, risk ratios for the respiratory disease-ozone association were 1.020 for ED visits and 1.004 for 'HA through ED'; risk ratios for the asthma/wheeze-ozone association were 1.069 for ED visits and 1.106 for 'HA through ED'. Several factors (e.g. age) were identified that may be responsible, in part, for the differences in observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and diagnostic differences between visit types may lead to preference for one visit type over another for some questions and populations. The strengths of observed associations with air pollutants sometimes varied between different health care visit types, but the relative strengths of association generally were specific to the pollutant-outcome combination.",

DESIGN: Case time series study. SETTING: US national administrative healthcare claims database. PARTICIPANTS: 50.1 million commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries aged ≥18 years between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily counts of hospital admissions and emergency department visits for natural causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease based on the primary diagnosis code. RESULTS: During the study period, 10.3 million hospital admissions and 24.1 million emergency department visits occurred for natural causes among 50.1 million adult enrollees across 2939 US counties. The daily PM2.5 levels were below the new WHO guideline limit of 15 μg/m3 for 92.6% of county days (7 360 725 out of 7 949 713). On days when daily PM2.5 levels were below the new WHO air quality guideline limit of 15 μg/m3, an increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 during the current and previous day was associated with higher risk of hospital admissions for natural causes, with an excess relative risk of 0.91% (95% confidence interval 0.55% to 1.26%), or 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 2.59) excess hospital admissions per million enrollees per day. The increased risk of hospital admissions for natural causes was observed exclusively among adults aged ≥65 years and was not evident in younger adults. PM2.5 levels were also statistically significantly associated with relative risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. For emergency department visits, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 during the current and previous day was associated with respiratory disease, with an excess relative risk of 1.34% (0.73% to 1.94%), or 0.93 (0.52 to 1.35) excess emergency department visits per million enrollees per day. This association was not found for natural causes or cardiovascular disease. The higher risk of emergency department visits for respiratory disease was strongest among middle aged and young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Among US adults with health insurance, exposure to ambient PM2.5 at concentrations below the new WHO air quality guideline limit is statistically significantly associated with higher rates of hospital admissions for natural causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, and with emergency department visits for respiratory diseases. These findings constitute an important contribution to the debate about the revision of air quality limits, guidelines, and standards.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Airborne pollutants may worsen the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previous studies have shown that both particulate and gaseous pollutants increase airway inflammation, which may lead to an exacerbation of COPD. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between exposure to airborne pollutants and the risk of COPD exacerbations in 3 the largest urban agglomerations in Poland: Warsaw, Kraków, and Tricity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a case‑crossover approach to analyze data from the years 2011-2018. This time‑series study used distributed lag linear-nonlinear models to analyze the risk of hospital admission due to COPD exacerbations during 21 days following the exposure to particulate matter (PM), NO2, and SO2. RESULTS: Overall, there were 26 948 admissions due to COPD exacerbations. During 21 days after exposure, the rate ratio (95% CI) for admissions per 10 μg/m3 was 1.028 (1.008-1.049) for PM10, 1.030 (1.006-1.055) for PM2.5, 1.032 (0.988-1.078) for NO2, and 1.145 (1.038-1.262) for SO2. The risk for admission peaked at 10 days after the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, whereas for NO2 and SO2 the risk was the greatest on the day of exposure. The proportion (95% CI) of hospitalizations attributable to air pollution was 9.08% (3.10%-15.08%) for PM10, 7.61% (1.27%-13.49%) for PM2.5, 9.77% (-3.63% to 21.48%) for NO2, and 7.70% (2.30%-12.84%) for SO2. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 pollution was associated with an increased risk of COPD exacerbations that needed hospitalization. There were different risk patterns for particulate and gaseous pollutants. Improving air quality in Polish cities could reduce the burden of COPD.",

      "title": "Distributed lag analyses of daily hospital admissions and source-apportioned fine particle air pollution.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Past time-series studies of the health effects of fine particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5)] have used chemically nonspecific PM2.5 mass. However, PM2.5 is known to vary in chemical composition with source, and health impacts may vary accordingly. OBJECTIVE: We tested the association between source-specific daily PM2.5 mass and hospital admissions in a time-series investigation that considered both single-lag and distributed-lag models. METHODS: Daily PM2.5 speciation measurements collected in midtown Manhattan were analyzed via positive matrix factorization source apportionment. Daily and distributed-lag generalized linear models of Medicare respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions during 2001-2002 considered PM2.5 mass and PM2.5 from five sources: transported sulfate, residual oil, traffic, steel metal works, and soil. RESULTS: Source-related PM2.5 (specifically steel and traffic) was significantly associated with hospital admissions but not with total PM2.5 mass. Steel metal works-related PM2.5 was associated with respiratory admissions for multiple-lag days, especially during the cleanup efforts at the World Trade Center. Traffic-related PM2.5 was consistently associated with same-day cardiovascular admissions across disease-specific subcategories. PM2.5 constituents associated with each source (e.g., elemental carbon with traffic) were likewise associated with admissions in a consistent manner. Mean effects of distributed-lag models were significantly greater than were maximum single-day effect models for both steel- and traffic-related PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: Past analyses that have considered only PM2.5 mass or only maximum single-day lag effects have likely underestimated PM2.5 health effects by not considering source-specific and distributed-lag effects. Differing lag structures and disease specificity observed for steel-related versus traffic-related PM2.5 raise the possibility of distinct mechanistic pathways of health effects for particles of differing chemical composition.",

      "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the relationship between air pollution and pediatric asthma in developing countries. This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits in Shanghai, China. We collected data on six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) and daily ED visits for pediatric asthma patients from 66 hospitals in Shanghai from 2016 to 2018. The generalized additive model combined with polynomial distributed lag model was applied to explore the associations. We fitted two-pollutant models and stratified the analyses by sex, age, and season. In total, we identified 108,817 emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 was significantly associated with increased risks of pediatric asthma ED visits, with relative risk of pediatric asthma of 1.011 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.002, 1.021], 1.030 (95%CI: 1.017, 1.043), 1.106 (95%CI: 1.041, 1.174), and 1.009 (95%CI: 1.001, 1.017), respectively. The associations of NO2 remained robust in the two-pollutant models. There were stronger associations for older children (6-18 years) and in warm seasons. The concentration-response curves for pediatric asthma and PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 were steeper at lower and moderate concentrations but became flatter at higher concentrations. This analysis provided evidence that short-term exposure to air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3) could increase the risk of asthma exacerbations among children, and health benefits would be gained from improved air quality.",

We investigated the relationship between hospitalization for ALRI in children and air pollutant concentrations from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2020 in Lanzhou City. METHODS: We collected data on air pollutant concentrations and children's hospitalization data during the study period. A time series regression analysis was used to assess the short-term effects of air pollutants on ALRI in children, and subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 51,206 children with ALRI were studied, including 40,126 cases of pneumonia and 11,080 cases of bronchiolitis. The results of the study revealed that PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were significantly associated with hospitalization for ALRI in children aged 0-14 years. For each 10 µg/m3 increase in air pollutant concentration in lag0-7, the relative risk of ALRI hospitalization in children due to PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 increased by 1.089 (95%CI:1.075, 1.103), 1.018 (95%CI:1.014, 1.021), 1.186 (95%CI:1.154. 1.219) and 1.149 (95%CI:1.130, 1.168), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the cardiopulmonary effects of short-term exposure to [Formula: see text] on smoke days in the United States to evaluate whether health effects are consistent with those during non-smoke days. METHODS: We examined cardiopulmonary hospitalizations among adults [Formula: see text] y of age, in U.S. counties ([Formula: see text]) within [Formula: see text] of 123 large wildfires during 2008-2010. We evaluated associations during smoke and non-smoke days and examined variability with respect to modeled and observed exposure metrics. Poisson regression was used to estimate county-specific effects at lag days 0-6 (L0-6), adjusted for day of week, temperature, humidity, and seasonal trend. We used meta-analyses to combine county-specific effects and estimate overall percentage differences in hospitalizations expressed per [Formula: see text] increase in [Formula: see text]. RESULTS: Exposure to [Formula: see text], on all days and locations, was associated with increased hospitalizations on smoke and non-smoke days using modeled exposure metrics. The estimated effects persisted across multiple lags, with a percentage increase of 1.08% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28, 1.89] on smoke days and 0.67% (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 1.44) on non-smoke days for respiratory and 0.61% (95% CI: 0.09, 1.14) on smoke days and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.2) on non-smoke days for cardiovascular outcomes on L1.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air pollution can cause respiratory symptoms or exacerbate pre-existing respiratory diseases, especially in children. This study looked at the short-term association of air pollution concentrations with Emergency Room (ER) admissions for respiratory reasons in pediatric age (0-18 years). METHODS: Daily number of ER admissions in a children's Hospital, concentrations of urban-background PM2.5, NO2, O3 and total aeroallergens (Corylaceae, Cupressaceae, Gramineae, Urticaceae, Ambrosia, Betula) were collected in Turin, northwestern Italy, for the period 1/08/2008 to 31/12/2010 (883 days). The associations between exposures and ER admissions were estimated, at time lags between 0 and 5 days, using generalized linear Poisson regression models, adjusted for non-meteorological potential confounders. RESULTS: In the study period, 21,793 ER admissions were observed, mainly (81 %) for upper respiratory tract infections. Median air pollution concentrations were 22.0, 42.5, 34.1 μg/m(3) for urban-background PM2.5, NO2, and O3, respectively, and 2.9 grains/m(3) for aeroallergens. We found that ER admissions increased by 1.3 % (95 % CI: 0.3-2.2 %) five days after a 10 μg/m(3) increase in NO2, and by 0.7 % (95 % CI: 0.1-1.2 %) one day after a 10 grains/m(3) increase in aeroallergens, while they were not associated with PM2.5 concentrations. ER admissions were negatively associated with O3 and aeroallergen concentrations at some time lags, but these association shifted to the null when meteorological confounders were adjusted for in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings confirm adverse short-term health effects of air pollution on the risk of ER admission in children and encourage a careful management of the urban environment to health protection.",

Prior investigations identified substantial adverse effects, including increases in the use of health services. In this study, we examined the effects on hospital and ambulance use in the eight years following the fire. METHODS: Using Victorian hospital (Jan 2009-Jun 2022) and ambulance (Jan 2013-Dec 2021) data, we conducted an interrupted time series of changes to the rate of hospital admissions, emergency presentations, and ambulance attendances. A categorical exposure model compared two locations, most-exposed Morwell and less-exposed Latrobe Valley, to the rest of regional Victoria. A continuous exposure model used spatial estimates of fire-related PM2.5. Analyses were stratified by sex, age group (<65/65+ years), and condition (cardiovascular, respiratory, mental health, injury). RESULTS: There were small but significant increases in overall hospital admissions and emergency presentations across all analyses, but little evidence of change in overall ambulance attendances. Effects varied considerably by condition, with the biggest relative increases observed among hospital admissions for mental health conditions and injuries. While cardiovascular-related hospital admissions and emergency presentations increased post-fire, ambulance attendances decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the Hazelwood coalmine fire likely increased hospital usage. However, it is unclear whether this was due to the direct effects of smoke exposure on health, or the disruptive socioeconomic and behavioural impacts of an environmental disaster that affected how communities engaged with various health services.",

      "abstract": "Upper and lower respiratory infections are common in early childhood and may be exacerbated by air pollution. We investigated short-term changes in ambient air pollutant concentrations, including speciated particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), in relation to emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory infections in young children. Daily counts of ED visits for bronchitis and bronchiolitis (n = 80,399), pneumonia (n = 63,359), and upper respiratory infection (URI) (n = 359,246) among children 0-4 years of age were collected from hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia, area for the period 1993-2010. Daily pollutant measurements were combined across monitoring stations using population weighting. In Poisson generalized linear models, 3-day moving average concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and the organic carbon fraction of particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) were associated with ED visits for pneumonia and URI. Ozone associations were strongest and were observed at low (cold-season) concentrations; a 1-interquartile range increase predicted a 4% increase (95% confidence interval: 2%, 6%) in visits for URI and an 8% increase (95% confidence interval: 4%, 13%) in visits for pneumonia. Rate ratios tended to be higher in the 1- to 4-year age group compared with infants. Results suggest that primary traffic pollutants, ozone, and the organic carbon fraction of PM2.5 exacerbate upper and lower respiratory infections in early life, and that the carbon fraction of PM2.5 is a particularly harmful component of the ambient particulate matter mixture.",
